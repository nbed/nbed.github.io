				<p>The desire for a consistent improvement planning framework for schools was
					identified by means of two major consultations. The first was a consultation
					which focused on the 10-year Education Plan implementation. The 10-year
					Education Plan Implementation Committee, which consisted of early childhood
					educators, representatives from the New Brunswick Teachers&rsquo;
					Association, First Nation educators, families, principals, classroom
					teachers, and education system leaders, led consultations with over 4800
					participants. When the team submitted their recommendations, the overarching
					request from the system was to establish clear expectations for implementing
					the 10-year Education Plan.</p>
				<p>The second consultation was system-wide and occurred between November 24th
					and December 1st, 2017. This took into consideration the views of educators
					working on the front lines and included 2497 individual and school
					submissions. Ongoing consultations, including focus groups and individual
					dialogues have occurred regularly following the larger consultations. From
					these consultations the desire for a consistent improvement framework to be
					used provincially throughout the four Anglophone School Districts was
					identified. Suggestions for content to be included in the Improvement
					Framework were also gathered from these systemic consultations. Ongoing
					dialogue with school, district and departmental personnel, accompanied by
					ongoing research, are used to inform the update of this document.</p>

				The domains are ordered hierarchically. The classroom environment operates

				operates in reverse.
				<br><br>
				The four domains are one way of grouping related practices to more easily
				see them as processes within a system. Practices at each level affect/inform
				those at higher and lower levels, so the degree to which they are
				intentionally aligned will impact effectiveness.
				<br><br>
				This does not mean all indicators in Domains I – III must be addressed
				before tackling <em>Classroom Practice</em>, or that indicators in any domain
				are more important than others.

				<p>
					This document has been created as a tool for school self-assessment as part
					of the development and monitoring of <em>School Improvement</em> and <em>Positive
					Learning and Working Environment</em> Plans.
				</p>
				<p>This document may be used to assist schools in completing a school-based
					self-assessment of their processes and practices. Schools may choose to use
					this tool to assist them in the development of their Improvement Plans
					(e.g., School Improvement Plan (SIP) and Positive Learning and Work
					Environment Plan (PLWEP)) by guiding them through the process of identifying
					areas of focus and potential strategies.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>There are several approaches that schools and districts could take when using
					the indicator document. School personnel could perform a self-assessment
					using the indicators. They could choose to have an external team come into
					the school and evaluate school performance based on the indicators. Finally,
					schools and districts could adopt a blended model, whereby schools
					self-assess and seek support from other district personnel who work outside
					of, but in collaboration with, the school. These individuals are termed
					school liaisons or critical friends in the School Improvement Framework.
					School liaisons can either act as a critical friend who provides direct
					support, or they can link schools to others (district personnel, like-sized
					and configured schools, principal or teacher mentors/supports) who then act
					as the critical friend providing direct support. <u>It is recommended that
						this document be used primarily as a tool to assist schools to
						self-assess during their annual self-evaluations. It can also be used on
						an ongoing basis for self-reflection and to promote continual growth.
					</u></p>
				<p><strong>Recommended</strong> <strong>Process for Self-Evaluation:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>School Improvement Teams can use the guiding questions at the beginning of
					each domain, in conjunction with school-based data (Teacher Perception
					Survey Data, Our School, meeting minutes, the existing SIP and PLWEP data
					monitoring), and other school, district and provincial data to determine
					areas of strength and initial areas of focus for growth.</p>
				<p>Once the initial areas of focus for growth are identified based on data and
					evidence, school teams are encouraged to drill down through the identified
					subdomains, indicators and sub-indicators, using explanatory notes and
					Inclusion Look-fors to support the rating of indicators and the selection of
					targeted areas for growth. The Inclusion Look-Fors, specify supports for
					specific individuals and groups. There are First Nations items that relate
					to all schools; not just schools with Enhancement Agreements. Every school
					has students who require PLPs and other extraordinary service delivery
					(Ability/Disability), and the reality of sexual minority populations is a
					universal that requires exploration and action in every school. School
					personnel should intentional in using this document to promote an inclusive
					environment for all. It is suggested that schools triangulate collected
					evidence to increase the reliability of the self-assessment. This should
					include teacher self-reflection, classroom observations, and objective
					analysis of both the structured and unstructured school day. Having targeted
					conversations with diverse members of the school community (teachers, admin
					staff, support staff, students, parents and other stakeholders as available)
					while viewing products (student work, lesson plans, meeting minutes, etc.)
					and formal processes would provide effective triangulation of data.&nbsp;

				<p><strong>Schools can choose to use the ratings below when completing their

						school teams are urged to be mindful of the purpose of this document as
						a vehicle for formative dialogue. The value of the discussion lies in
						coming to agreement on the current situation, and establishing
						priorities for focused action, not the rating.</strong></p>
				<p>The labels for the ratings are: <strong>Very <em>Evident (VE), Mostly Evident
							(ME), Somewhat Evident (SE) and Not Evident (NE)</em>.</strong></p>
				<p style="margin-left: 1em;"><strong>VE:</strong> You&rsquo;ve nailed it &ndash; keep maintaining the
					processes and knowledge needed to preserve this practice (embedded and
					consistent practice)</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 1em;"><strong>ME:</strong> You have processes and procedures in place and are
					partway there &ndash; don&rsquo;t slow down</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 1em;"><strong>SE:</strong> You have a plan and a step or two &ndash; decide whether
					it&rsquo;s a priority because it will take some dedication to implement</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 1em;"><strong>NE:</strong> You haven&rsquo;t considered it because you didn&rsquo;t
					think it was important, or don&rsquo;t know how to begin &ndash; you need
					some help to get started (<strong><u>if</u></strong> it&rsquo;s a priority)
				</p>
				<p>The following is proposed as a guide for determining ratings. Only
					<strong><em>Very Evident</em></strong> is defined. This approach was chosen
					in order to avoid inflexible rubrics while providing sufficient guidance to
					support uniform rating decisions.</p>
				<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; border-radius: 1em; margin: 1em 0;">
					<p><strong>Very Evident</strong></p>
					<p><strong><em>The evidence indicates that this look-for is consistently
								demonstrated, well-established, and sustainable (processes,
							</em></strong></p>
					<p><strong><em>knowledge, skills, data, and ongoing monitoring and adjustment
								are required for this to be in place).</em></strong></p>
				</div>
				<p><strong>Questions to consider when using a rating of <u>Very
							Evident</u>:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Is this part of the way we do business (pervasive, routine, part of the
						school culture)?</li>
					<li>Would this survive if the leadership changed?</li>
					<li>Is there a process for induction of new staff members?</li>
					<li>Is this a school-wide approach?</li>
					<li>Is it consistently demonstrated by staff &ndash; or just pockets of
						staff, or certain groups of staff?</li>
					<li>Is it documented with data and evidence or artifacts?</li>
					<li>Would your staff be able to explain/speak to this practice?</li>
					<li>Are staff members willing to share this practice with others or have
						others come to your school or class to observe?</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Note: </strong>Indicators are rated by triangulating evidence from a
					variety of sources including observations, conversations and products.</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>School leadership teams consult a range of data and evidence to
									identify a limited number of school goals/areas of focus (i.e.
									recommended not exceeding five) for improvement. Continuous
									improvement planning includes and supports the academic,
									behavioural, social-emotional, and cultural engagement, development
									inclusion and development of all learners. Teacher teams further
									analyze evidence of learning to identify the root causes of
									achievement gaps, develop one to two learning targets (i.e. SMART
									goals), design actions, and implement interventions. Leadership
									teams monitor team progress towards their targets as well as
									collective growth towards the global priorities. Strategic school
									initiatives, including responsive professional learning, are
									implemented to support continuous improvement.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>SMART refers to goals that are: Strategic, Measurable,
									Action-oriented, Realistic and Time-bound. Although there are
									multiple versions of the SMART acronym including the original
									definition by George T. Doran (1981), this version most easily lends
									itself to School Improvement Planning. All goals should be action
									oriented and strategies should lead to progress towards addressing
									identified learning targets. For schools who may find the SMART goal
									approach challenging, please work to address two priorities when
									establishing data: 1. Present Level of Performance (PLOP), and 2.
									ongoing monitoring to ensure progress towards identified goals.</p>
								<p>Teams use PLOP to identify an area of focus/school goal. Through data
									analysis, a learning target(s) is created. (e.g., By December 15th,
									18 of 22 of our grade 3 students will begin sentences in different
									ways and write different sentence lengths.) Only 2-3 actions should
									be identified, each of which are expected to impact the measure
									(e.g., sentence structure &ldquo;Write Trait&rdquo;).</p>
								<p>Effective goals contain measures (i.e. what the students have
									learned). Provincial assessment scores and term-based report card
									ratings are not reasonable measures. Appropriate measures are based
									upon a combination of varied sources of evidence of student
									learning. For example, the measure in the above-mentioned learning
									target is different sentence beginnings and lengths.</p>
								<p>Effective goals also allow teams to plan and implement actions
									strategically. They also promote the importance of monitoring to
									ensure teams are moving in the right direction to be successful in
									achieving the desired results.</p>
								<p>Effective goals are based upon short time frames (e.g., four to six
									weeks) that create a practical sense of urgency between the current
									reality and the preferred future. Teams regularly review the
									learning target(s), relevant data and identify which students are
									progressing toward and/or meeting the goal(s), and plan
									interventions for students who are not developing the required
									skills (e.g., EST-R provided tier 2 in-class academic
									interventions).</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>By November 1, 20XX our high school attendance rate for Friday
										afternoon classes will be at least 90%</li>

									manageable number. Research indicates that it is beneficial to establish a
									maximum of five school-wide goals in each improvement plan with three being
									the preferred number (Duke; Carr; Sterrett, and Wooleyhand, 2014, p.71). A
									single focused goal may be adequate, if it is identified as the primary area
									for growth, has relevant actions associated, is continually monitored, and

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Job-embedded professional learning occurs while teachers and administrators
									engage in their daily work. Teachers learn by doing and reflecting on their
									teaching experiences and then generating and sharing new insights and
									learning collaboratively.</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES: </u></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Reflection: (Ongoing teacher planning, instruction, and reflection) is a
										process which supports self-directed personalized learning. Lesson plans
										which include an area for post-lesson reflection can be a helpful tool
										to promote ongoing refinement of pedagogical practices&nbsp;</li>
									<li>Action Research: Professional Learning Communities (PLC) house groups of
										teachers who answer questions tied to instructional practices, through
										action research. PLC binders store identified targets, agendas, and
										meeting minutes. Meeting minutes should demonstrate that teachers are
										learning about new practices and/or refining existing practices to close
										achievement gaps and meet their identified goals (Sagor,2000).</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Some additional collaborative opportunities for job-embedded
										professional learning include: </strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>CPT (common planning time)</li>
									<li>Grade-level team meetings</li>
									<li>Departmental meetings</li>
									<li>Co-planning and co-teaching</li>
									<li>Observation and formative feedback- school leaders</li>
									<li>Small group: focus hours, lunch and learns, article/book studies</li>
									<li>Whole group: school-based professional learning days, school-based
										teacher PL blogs or teacher sharing sites</li>
									<li>Action research</li>

							<div class="header-subsection-text">
								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>In order to understand the impact of professional learning on student
									achievement, schools should consider how professional learning will be
									evaluated. One approach is Guskey&rsquo;s model of evaluation. We tend to
									evaluate only the first two levels; it is recommended that the remaining
									areas be considered with a specific focus on the impact on students.</p>
								<p><strong>LEVEL 1: Participant Reaction</strong>: Did they like it? Was their
									time well spent? Did the materials make sense? Was it useful?</p>
								<p><strong>LEVEL 2: Participant Learning: </strong>Did participants acquire the
									intended knowledge and skills?</p>
								<p><strong>LEVEL 3: Organization Support &amp; Change: </strong>What was the
									impact on the organization? Was implementation advocated, facilitated and
									supported? Were problems addressed quickly? Were sufficient resources made
									available?</p>
								<p><strong>LEVEL 4: Participants&rsquo; Use of New Knowledge and Skill:
									</strong>Were new knowledge and skills effectively applied? What evidence?
								</p>
								<p><strong>LEVEL 5: Student Learning Outcome: What was the impact on students?
									</strong>Did it affect student achievement? Is student attendance changing?
									Are dropouts decreasing? Are students more confident learners?</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<p>- School team members discuss which strategies they have implemented from a
									science instructional resource which was introduced by district personnel
									one month ago</p>
								<p>- Principal gathers observational feedback on teacher use of school-selected
									Before Reading strategies that were modelled during a school-based PL day
								</p>
								<p>- A literacy coordinator is invited to debrief with teachers on the successes
									and challenges of a new initiative, program, resource, etc.</p>

									Needs Assessment (BLNA) to determine professional learning plan adjustments

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>In this context, data refers to the any quantified materials used to inform
									school goals. Evidence includes observations and conversations which occur
									to either bolster or refute what the data is indicating. Once evidence is
									quantified, it becomes data. Student achievement data refers to school-based
									assessments, district assessments and large-scale provincial assessments.
									Schools should gather and monitor assessment data frequently to provide
									support for teaching and learning.</p>
								<p>Staff members and teams are encouraged to drill down into the data to
									identify the root causes of issues or challenges.</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Some examples of routine gathering and monitoring of data include:</p>
								<p>- District and school-based benchmarking (running records, common
									assessments)</p>
								<p>- Monitoring (Data Walls, PLC/Team meeting minutes, Education Support
									Services Team meeting, SIP Monitoring Template)</p>
								<p>Provincial data should be closely monitored by staff to determine
									longitudinal trends of cohorts of students. Staff should use this data to
									compare to district and provincial trends.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Teachers should be aware of weighting and other test characteristics of
									provincial assessments which are described in testing specification
									documents, typically found in the appendix of the assessment. Awareness of
									this information will help schools to plan and support school-wide
									interventions.</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>The intent of this indicator is to ensure data use for the monitoring of
									important school goals, where the direct outcome is something other than an
									increase in assessment results (e.g., social-emotional, physical, and
									cultural growth). For example, Our School data and informal discussions with
									at-risk students suggest that increased social engagement could improve
									attendance and eventually achievement of a group of marginalized students.
									Question schools could consider:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>What is the behaviour you wish to impact directly?</li>
									<li>How will you be able to tell? What data will be collected?</li>
									<li>What is your baseline (Present Level of Performance)?</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Observations and anecdotal information need to be turned into
									&ldquo;trackable&rdquo; data.</p>
								<p>Data sources could include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Our School data</li>
									<li>School-generated student/family/staff survey data</li>
									<li>Observable strategies</li>
									<li>Powerschool data</li>
									<li>Participation in student-driven initiatives (e.g., student-led
										fundraising, working with senior citizens, co-op opportunities,
										volunteering, Student Representative Council (SRC) and other
										co-curricular activities)</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Stretch Learning is defined</strong> as the demonstration of rigorous
									and relevant learning beyond minimum requirements.&hellip; for educators
									stretch learning means providing active rigorous and relevant learning
									conditions for students &ldquo;within the content area&rdquo; &hellip; For
									students stretch learning provides frequent opportunities in every school
									setting to go beyond the basic requirements and access the resources and
									technology to demonstrate that learning (Stretch Learning, International
									Center for Leadership, p.1). Stretch learning opportunities are focused on
									advancing learning opportunities within the content area as opposed to
									enrichment which is broader in that it is not limited to the topic or area
									of study.</p>
								<p><strong>Some of the most effective ways to offer stretch learning
										opportunities for advanced students are:</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Increased student choice</li>
									<li>Peer learning opportunities</li>
									<li>Project-based learning</li>
									<li>Problem-based learning</li>
									<li>High interest/experiential&nbsp;learning</li>
									<li>Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy/higher order questioning techniques</li>
									<li>Tiered activities</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLE:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Analysis of <em>Our School</em> (playground info and change) student
									perception survey data may lead a team to identify student social engagement
									as an area of focus in their School Improvement Plan. During the delivery of
									varied opportunities to support personal and leadership skill development
									(e.g., Peer Helpers, sports programming, Student Leadership Council), Alpha
									Stars students could complete surveys which allow the team to measure their
									impact on student development of these skills.</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Administrators wish to increase higher-order questioning throughout the

										Language Arts and content-area subject classes, and that the mathematics
										teachers need to improve this skill set. The administrators support
										mathematics teachers by facilitating partnership learning and providing
										on-going feedback</li>
									<li>Grade 4-5 school team noted through <em>Our School</em> data analysis
										that student engagement was lower than expected. The team co-constructed
										engagement criteria in order to gather further data on engagement;
										teachers collected data and monitored engagement using these criteria in
										their classrooms. At the next team meeting they decided to set
										strategies and targets to increase engagement over the next month</li>

									learning (in-class support based on text/video instructions) and
									experiential project work. Options should be provided for both synchronous
									and asynchronous learning supports.</p>

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION: </strong></p>
								<p>The teachers and ESTs have a collaborative process for identifying
										students who may require or benefit from accommodations. For example,
										teachers use an accommodation checklist to track and monitor the use of
										universal accommodations. Frequent intervention and assessment provide
										data needed to inform decision-making. Prior to creating a PLP, there is
										a referral process and a collaborative dialogue with the ESS Team.
								</p>
								<p><strong>DEFINITION:</strong></p>
								<p>A Personalized Learning Plan (PLP) is a plan for a student who
										requires specific and individual identification of practical strategies,
										goals, outcomes, targets and educational supports that ensure the
										student experiences success in learning that is meaningful and
										appropriate, considering the student&rsquo;s individual needs.x
								</p>
								<p>Accommodation &ndash; an accommodation is intended to help the
										student to fully access and participate in the prescribed curriculum
										without changing the instructional content (Skinner, Pappas, &amp;
										Davis, 2005). An accommodation is intended to remove barriers to
										learning while still expecting that students will master the same
										instructional content as their typical peers.
								</p>
								<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
									<p><strong>Universal accommodations </strong>&ndash; are strategies,
										technologies or adjustments that enable a student to reach prescribed
										outcomes and can be used as needed. Universal accommodations do not
										necessitate a PLP or prior approval for provincial assessments.</p>
									<p>School personnel know that <strong>universal accommodations</strong> are
										intended to help students to fully access and participate in the
										<strong>prescribed</strong> curriculum without changing the instructional
										content. Students master the same content as their peers. This includes
										accommodated:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>presentation/delivery of curricular outcomes</li>
										<li>product /means by which students demonstrate learning</li>
										<li>process/environment</li>
									</ul>
									<p><strong>Justified accommodations</strong> &ndash; are documented strategies,
										technologies or adjustments without which the student <strong>would
											not</strong> be able to access the curriculum and/or demonstrate their
										knowledge. These accommodations are documented within a PLP and require
										prior approval to be accessed during provincial assessments.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>A <strong>scribe</strong> would be a justified accommodation if the
											child would not be able to succeed without the accommodation</li>
										<li><strong>Extended time </strong>would be a justified accommodation if it
											were more than double the time</li>
									</ul>
									<p><strong>Adjusted Curricular Outcomes &ndash; </strong>for students who
										require adjustments to the curriculum to be successful. The general intent
										of the curriculum is maintained but the depth of treatment of the outcomes
										is altered or deleted.</p>
									<p><strong>Individualization </strong>&ndash; plans for students who need
										personalized planning that is outside of the prescribed curriculum.</p>
								</div>
								<p><strong>Policy 322 </strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>3.2 (1) have PLPs that are developed by a planning team consisting of
										the school administration, teacher(s), relevant members of the education
										support services (ESS)team, as well as parents, the student, and
										educational assistants as appropriate, and support people from community
										organizations as required</li>
									<li>3.2 (5) ensure the PLP includes transition strategies developed in
										collaboration with the student, his or her parents and any
										representatives from community agencies that will be involved in the
										student&rsquo;s life following high school</li>
									<li>3.3 (2) develop, implement and update the PLP (whenever significant
										modifications are required) in collaboration with parents, the student,
										teachers, ESS team members, including relevant educational assistants,
										professionals and representatives from community agencies as required
									</li>
									<li>3.4 (2) when a student requires learning outcomes other than those of
										the provincial curriculum, his or her parents are fully informed of, and
										have consented to, the anticipated effects on the education of the
										student.</li>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Educators should focus on groups who may be marginalized within and beyond
									the learning environment. These groups include, but are not limited to,
									First Nations populations, culturally and linguistically diverse students,
									newcomers, English Language Learners (ELLs), LGBTQI2S+ students and their
									supporters (Tranter, Carson and Boland, 2018, p. 128).</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Anti-Oppressive education makes explicit the idea that education, like
									all social institutions, can perpetuate the oppression of some students
									based on their background and social status, and seeks to remove oppressive
									practices wherever possible&rdquo; (Tranter, Carson and Boland, 2018, p.
									128).</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Anti- oppressive practice in an educational context seeks to identify
									oppressive practices in classrooms, schools, and educational policies in
									order to make education more socially just, as well as to make society more
									just&rdquo; (Tranter, Carson and Boland, 2018, p. 128).</p>
								<p>General strategies are as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Ensuring that teaching materials represent all groups equitably</li>
									<li>Directly challenging the misrepresentation of groups or the one-sided
										nature of information, if/when found in teaching materials</li>
									<li>Rethinking class activities and assignments to relocate marginalized
										students to a higher status</li>
									<li>Encouraging assignments that challenge mainstream thinking and
										traditional narratives about social and cultural ideals</li>
									<li>Ensuring that all students are fully integrated and are full
										participants in the classroom (Tranter, Carson and Boland, 2018, p. 128)
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Educators and students show that they genuinely value diversity, in all its
									forms:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>They are culturally aware, sensitive and inclusive</li>
									<li>They are aware that we all hold internal, and often unconscious, biases
										(self-awareness) that may need to be examined</li>
									<li>They know the students</li>
									<li>They work to bridge differences among students</li>
									<li>They intentionally include all students</li>
									<li>They connect with families and the community (Tranter, Carson and
										Boland, 2018, pp. 129-131)</li>

								<p><strong><u>DEFINITION:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong><em>Common learning environment:</em></strong> an inclusive learning
									environment is one where instruction is designed to be delivered to students
									of mixed ability and of the same age in their neighborhood school, while
									being responsive to their individual needs as a learner and used for the
									majority of the students&rsquo; regular instruction hours. <em>Policy 322
										&ndash; Inclusive Education</em></p>
								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Physical inclusion includes:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Alternate placement is planned for as a temporary situation and
										monitored on an ongoing basis, as indicated in Policy 322. Maximum
										integration (in the best interests of the child) in the regular learning
										environment is preferred</li>
									<li>Use of assistive technology to maximize student integration into the
										common learning environment</li>
									<li>Physical accessibility to all areas used by students, including ensuring
										wheelchair access for students and/or adults</li>
									<li>Planning in advance to accommodate upcoming needs</li>
									<li>Maximum integration and engagement of students in the common
										learning/classroom environment; students should not be consistently in
										the back or periphery of classes unless there is a justifiable reason or
										a student preference</li>
									<li>All decisions and placements should be in the best interests of the
										student(s)</li>
									<li>When a student is removed from the common learning environment for
										intervention, either academic or behavioral, there is an established
										plan for reintegration. See policy 322</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong><u>LOOK FOR:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong><em>Products:</em></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>There is a contingency plan for students with physical challenges for
										access and safety in all situations (e.g., evacuation protocol)</li>
									<li>Field trip plan for all students is collaboratively developed to ensure
										equal opportunities for all students</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong><em>Conversations:</em></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Students with disabilities indicating they have access to the same
										things as other students</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong><em>Observations:</em></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>All necessary physical structures are in place within and outside the
										school to provide access</li>
									<li>No permanent separate classrooms for students based on ability</li>
									<li>All students are participating in physical education class</li>

								</ul>
								<p><strong>Assistive Technology</strong></p>
								<p>Students with diverse needs have the supports and assistive technology needed
									to participate fully in the common learning environment.</p>
								<p>Assistive technology is used primarily for individual students requiring
									devices, media and services used by students with physical, cognitive,
									sensory, speech, learning or behavioural difficulties. These
									devices/supports allow students to actively engage in improving or
									maintaining their ability to meet learning outcomes and maximize their
									learning success. In most cases, the assistive technology required will be
									needed by these students throughout their school careers and should travel
									with them from class to class, grade to grade and school to school.</p>
								<p>Assistive technology is acquired through application to EECD through the
									<em>Assistive Technology for Learning Program</em> (ATL).</p>
								<p>Assistive technology may include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Specialized computer software (e.g., Kurzweil, Dragon Naturally
										Speaking)</li>
									<li>Generic computer software (e.g., Word, Excel)</li>

								<p><strong>Cultural Inclusion</strong>:</p>
								<p>Personnel intentionally communicate information about many cultures. While

									at the school. There is a process for searching out and including relevant
									content. Effort is made to highlight accomplishments. Current events
									involving particular cultural groups are presented and discussed in a
									neutral and respectful manner. Students are encouraged to reflect on the

								<p>&ldquo;Those who may be marginalized&rdquo; refers to individuals and groups
									whose characteristics are associated with systemic or chronic risk factors
									(e.g., low SES, non-attendance, high family mobility, minorities,
									newcomers/ELLs, sexual minority and gender independent (LGBTQI2S+) youth,
									students/family members with mental health concerns). When applied to
									students the term &ldquo;marginalized populations&rdquo; (formerly
									identified as at-risk populations), includes those who have a strong
									potential for school drop out, self-harm, or failure to thrive.</p>
								<p>The school has processes in place for identifying these students and
									families, intentionally building connections and supports, and ensuring
									advocacy. This includes gathering data about the composition of the student
									body and school community to plan for internal and external supports. It
									also includes assigning staff and students to make daily, informal contact
									with those who are vulnerable.</p>
								<p>Identified students require added supports to be able to access education on
									an equal basis with others. In complex cases school personnel collaborate
									with district, Department of Social Development, and Child and Youth.</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>In effective schools, personnel intentionally take note of the composition of
									the community served by the school and the characteristics of the families,
									honouring diverse family compositions and a variety of family traditions.
									Once resources and needs among families are identified, processes are
									established to engage families, taking diverse values, composition, and
									needs into account. This includes families who may have economic, social
									and/or cultural challenges, or characteristics that impact their experiences
									in the school community. For example, in many New Brunswick schools EAL
									(English as an Additional Language) programs have been organized for
									families who have emigrated from various regions of the world (newcomers).
									Some schools have made progress in recognizing and welcoming families with
									members who have non-traditional gender identities and/or sexual
									orientation. This also includes honouring the desired involvement and
									contributions of extended, blended and separated families that wish to
									support their children. In the era of COVID, alternate structures should be
									put in place to to support being invitational and communicative despite the
									fact that drop ins are not encouraged given the need for controlled access
									to schools to prevent the spread of the virus. These structures could
									include promoting other means of communication and participation using
									existing technologies (e.g. the Internet, video conferencing, phones, etc.).
								</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Information sent home is brief, clear and easy to understand</li>
									<li>Copies of student report cards and other important information is
										provided to both families when they are separated (custody order
										permitting)</li>
									<li>Information is made accessible in many ways, including up-to-date web
										pages</li>
									<li>School personnel who answer the phone and receive families arriving at
										the school have a service orientation and understand the impact they
										make on relationships with the school</li>
									<li>Volunteers are recruited who can help to translate, provide testimony of
										service and support new families whose children have diverse needs</li>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>The <strong>Distributive leadership Team (e.g. <em>Core Leadership Team</em> - CLT)</strong> is composed of the Principal, Vice-Principal and a selection of key teacher leaders. This should include Education Support Teacher-Guidance (EST-G) and Education Support Teacher - Resource (EST-R) representation. Like all learning teams in the school, this team should be organized in a very structured manner. Team time should be regularly scheduled; norms should be established; agendas should be created; minutes should be kept, and goals and follow-up actions should be developed and monitored. Since the key objective of the <strong><em>Leadership Team</em></strong> is to help facilitate continuous improvement, change and growth, ensuring effective reciprocal communication, reporting to the entire staff, soliciting feedback, monitoring school-based teams and monitoring the Improvement Plan on a routine basis are critical responsibilities of this team.</p>
								<p><strong><u>DEFINITION:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong><em>Distributed or distributive leadership</em></strong> involves a greater degree of distributing power, information and decision-making authority to individuals within the system. This includes &ldquo;the free-flowing form of ongoing engagement by stakeholders&hellip; it&hellip;honors the input and capabilities of all who have a stake in the affairs of the school&rdquo; (Daresh, 2007, p. 123). Current literature includes a number of terms for this concept (e.g., Guiding Coalition, Core Leadership Team and School Management Team). Which model a school chooses to implement will depend upon its size, configuration and school goals.&nbsp;</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong><em>Shared decision-making</em></strong> refers to making decisions collaboratively, calling upon the assistance of, and feedback from, staff and team members, either collectively or in part depending on the nature of the situation. The key to successful shared decision-making practices is to ensure all staff members clearly understand their roles and responsibilities as well as understanding and respecting that not all decisions can be made in a &ldquo;shared&rdquo; manner. In some instances, the school leader must make decisions independently based on data, evidence or policy requirements.</p>
								<p>One characteristic of shared decision-making is evidence of effective two-way communication between school administrators and staff members.</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>School leaders (e.g., administrators, SPRs, department heads, ESTs, etc.) know whether students are progressing towards identified learning or behaviour targets and interventions are in place to support them. School leaders monitor individual and team practices to ensure ongoing growth. Dewitt, (2017), states that Instructional leadership occurs, &ldquo;when those in a leadership position focus their efforts on the implementation of practices that will positively impact student learning (p.6). Effective leaders should work to ensure that individual and team practices are focused on continual growth. Leaders that detect ineffective individual and team practices should respond accordingly.</p>
								<p><em>Helpful questions: Attend meeting and/or respond to information emanating from meetings (e.g., minutes, plans)</em></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Does this teaming structure have a clear purpose? Is the purpose being met?</li>
									<li>Are previously identified action items reviewed? Were they acted upon?</li>
									<li>Are minutes taken during meetings? Are &lsquo;actions items&rsquo; clearly identified?</li>
									<li>Is data being used to monitor student progress toward the SMART targets? Is the SIP monitored regularly?</li>
									<li>Are the individuals responsible for leading and monitoring initiatives clearly identified?</li>
									<li>Is there a balance of voices and shared decision-making?</li>
									<li>Are academic/behavioural interventions being collaboratively identified and implemented? Is frequent assessment being used to monitor interventions?</li>
								</ul>
								<p>School leaders participate in team monitoring of SIP goals. During formalized meeting time, PLC team members:&nbsp;</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Review the identified goals</li>
									<li>Review relevant data</li>
									<li>Identify which students are progressing and/or have met the goals</li>
									<li>Plan interventions for students who are not developing the required behavior and skills (e.g., EST-R-provided tier 2 in-class academic or behavioural interventions)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>When school leaders are unable to participate in team meetings, they could:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Initiate a follow-up conversation with a team member, by asking, &ldquo;Are students learning what we need them to learn?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are we going to reach or exceed our March behavior target for student X?&rdquo;</li>
									<li>View the contents of the team&rsquo;s PLC binder, which should include: targeted goals, relevant data, the individuals responsible for leading and monitoring initiatives, planning for core instruction and interventions, SIP monitoring template (evidence of success).</li>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>The principal ensures a mechanism in place for teachers to receive ongoing feedback. This does not mean the principal alone must provide all of the feedback. Feedback may be provided by a designate (for example, VP, SPR, or Department Head). This indicator does not include formal, evaluative feedback (see Indicator 11.5).</p>
								<p>During the pre-observation conference/discussion, teachers self-identify an area for which they want formative feedback. Specific feedback is then provided to the teacher, post-observation.</p>
								<p>Part of Formal Teacher Evaluation:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Principal-provided Walkthroughs (as part of the formal performance evaluation)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Not Part of Formal Teacher Evaluation:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Collegial Walkthroughs</li>
									<li>Peer Visitation</li>
									<li>EST-provided observations/feedback</li>
									<li>Administrator/SPR &ndash;provided observations/walkthroughs</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Feedback includes comments on what was observed, highlighted practices and areas for further reflection and growth. Feedback is based on NB Curriculum documents, Look-fors and/or standards and can be written or orally communicated. Schools collectively identify an area for growth and develop a formative assessment observation model.</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLE:</u></strong></p>
								<p>By looking at data from <em>Our School </em>the school determined that student engagement was lower than expected. The staff co-constructed criteria for what student engagement would look like in all classes and developed a short look-for. Over the next three weeks SPR&rsquo;s, Vice Principals and Resource teachers will complete walkthroughs throughout the school to gather data on established criteria. Staff will then review summary results to determine next steps.</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Effective school leaders establish structures for providing <strong><em>formal feedback</em></strong> to all teachers (new, mid-career and veteran) on a regularly scheduled basis. Tools such as Danielson&rsquo;s <strong><em>Framework for</em></strong><em> <strong>Enhancing Professional Practice</strong></em> may be used to accomplish this task. Feedback is documented and includes regularly scheduled observations and conferences.&nbsp;</p>
								<p><strong>Suggested Time Frame </strong></p>
								<p>Long- term supply teachers, new schedule D teachers and new B contract teachers should have an annual formal performance evaluation. <strong>All other teachers should receive formal feedback every five years as a minimum standard.</strong> Formal evaluations could be scheduled by individual (e.g., every teacher is evaluated every three to five), or based on a percentage of the teaching staff annually (e.g., 1/3 of teaching staff each year). High achieving schools generally establish cycles which meet or exceed the minimal requirements set by Districts and/or EECD.</p>
								<p>Each district has prescribed standards for formal teacher evaluation.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>All teachers should receive regular informal feedback in the way of walkthroughs, observations, and professional growth goal conferencing (see Indicator 11.4). Pre- and post-conferencing should occur. <strong>Whenever possible, a face-to-face collaborative dialogue between the teacher and administrator should occur, pre- and post-observation. </strong>Feedback includes comments on what was observed, highlighted practices and areas for further reflection and growth.</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Collective efficacy is defined as &ldquo;a group's shared belief in its conjoint capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given levels of attainments&rdquo; (Bandura, 1997, p. 477). Effective teams operate as a professional learning community which serves to promote the sharing of knowledge, thereby helping to advance individual as well as collective efficacy. This community of practice is a collaboration of educators who work together to establish essential learning outcomes, seek out research-based best practices, test them out in the classroom, and then continuously improve processes based on results (Donohoo, 2017; Dufour, Dufour, Eaker, Many, and Mattos, 2016).</p>
								<p><em>Please note: Some team responsibilities are legislated and delineated in policy. For example, the school-based ESS Team must meet on a regular basis, preferably once a week, but at least every 10 school days. (</em>Policy 322 for school-based ESS Teams; s.6.10.3)&nbsp;</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong>School-based common assessments</strong> are designed by teachers to provide formative feedback to improve teaching and learning. These are developed to ensure consistency of standards among teachers. Common assessments are used at various points in the year (end of unit, term/semester, and end of year) and are not necessarily lengthy. Common assessments are given by two or more instructors with the intention of collaboratively examining the results for:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Shared learning</li>
									<li>Instructional planning for individual students</li>
									<li>As a team, identify which targets from the assessment require more attention?</li>
									<li>As a team, identify which students did not master which targets?</li>
									<li>As a team, identify which classrooms require additional support?</li>
									<li>As an individual teacher, determine which area was my lowest, and how can I improve in that area?</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES: </u></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Grade 3 teachers create and administer common assessments every two weeks to<strong> monitor</strong> student learning and provide next steps for instruction</li>
									<li>High School teachers may create a common end of unit assessment to <strong>verify</strong> student learning</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Benchmark assessments are given periodically throughout the school year at specified times. The assessments evaluate students&rsquo; knowledge and skills relative to an explicit set of longer-term goals, usually curriculum outcomes. The design and choice of benchmark assessment is driven by purpose and intended users, and informs decision-making at the student, classroom, school and/or district level. There should be a balance between school and district developed benchmarks.&nbsp;</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Student achievement data refers to school-based assessments, district assessments and large-scale provincial, national and international assessments. Schools should gather and monitor assessment data frequently to provide support for teaching and learning.</p>

									<li>Monitoring (Data Walls, dashboards, PLC Team Meetings meeting minutes, ESS Team Meeting, SIP Monitoring Template)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Provincial data should be closely monitored by staff to determine longitudinal trends associated with cohorts of students. Staff should use this data to compare to district and provincial trends.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Teachers should be aware of weighting and other test characteristics of provincial assessments which are described in testing specification documents. These are typically found in the appendix of the assessment. Awareness of this information will help schools to plan and support effective school-wide interventions.</p>

								<p><strong><em>Learning Styles</em></strong> can be defined as the usual or characteristic way in which a learner goes about the task of learning. People perceive and learn in different ways. It is believed that most people favour some particular method of interacting with, taking in and processing stimuli and information.

								<p>School leaders, teachers, support staff, students and families collaborate to

									is personalized with scaffolding being used to ensure that lessons challenge
									students at their level while ensuring that student potential for academic,
									behavioral, and social-emotional growth is maximized.</p>
								<p>In order to ensure high expectations, the fundamentals of personalization
									should be applied. Bryk identifies &ldquo;The Six Core Principles of
									Improvement&rdquo; which may facilitate improved personalized learning:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Make the work problem-specific and user-centered.</li>
									<li>Variation in performance is the core problem to address.</li>
									<li>See the system that produces the current outcomes.</li>
									<li>We cannot improve at scale what we cannot measure.</li>
									<li>Anchor practice improvement in disciplined inquiry (Engage in rapid
										cycles of Plan, Do, Study, Act).</li>
									<li>Accelerate improvements through networked communities.</li>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Reflective practitioners are those who engage in &ldquo;a cognitive process
									carried out in order to learn from experiences through individual inquiry
									and collaboration with others&rdquo; (Ambady, 2018). Reflective practice
									should include planning, administration of the lesson(s), checking for
									comprehension and analysis of whether the desires learning targets were
									achieved, and then adjusting the instruction to improve the lesson(s) or
									reteach as needed to meet the desired outcomes.</p>
								<p>In this indicator, <strong><em>innovation</em></strong> refers to
									experimenting with new pedagogical practices or processes in response to
									professional learning and/or information gathering/data analysis. Controlled
									risk-taking in conjunction with <strong><em>action research</em></strong>
									(Lewin &amp; Weiss Lewin, 1946) can help educators to discover/adjust
									practices in an efficient, strategic manner. Examples could include a focus
									on experiential learning, global competency-based education, as well as
									problem- and project-based learning.</p>
								<p>In order to improve student learning, teachers work toward collective growth
									and efficacy (Donohoo, 2017), and are part of a culture of continuous
									improvement and are willing to experiment with new methods, strategies,
									approved online tools, and a variety of approaches in their teaching. They
									also encourage, plan for, and foster, risk-taking learning opportunities and
									activities for their students.</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Student-led instruction</li>
									<li>Peer assisted learning strategies</li>
									<li>Online learning opportunities</li>
									<li>Flipped classrooms</li>
									<li>Action research</li>
									<li>Online tools (approved)</li>

							<div class="header-subsection-text">
								<p><strong><u>SYSTEMATIC EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Common behavioural expectations are built through the co-constructing of the
									Code of Conduct with school leaders, teachers, educational support staff,
									students, and families. Staff members develop behavioral protocols such as:
									communication of rules to students, response to inappropriate behaviour, and
									reporting of inappropriate behaviour.</p>
								<p>Once behavioural expectations are established and communicated, all personnel
									are responsible for responding to inappropriate behaviour in a uniform
									manner (i.e., not ignoring it). All personnel must respond consistently
									(i.e., rules and <u>equitable</u> responses are applied throughout the
									learning environment).</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Rule: cell phones must be off in every class until the teacher
									requests/permits their use for educational purposes.</p>
								<p>Consequence for infraction: cell phone is left with the teacher until the end
									of the class.</p>
								<p><strong>Supporting Behavioural Growth</strong></p>
								<p>The application does not, however, mean inflexible, one-size-fits-all
									consequences. Although consistency and uniformity are important, students
									must also understand the primary intent of consequences is to eliminate
									undesirable behaviour and foster positive behaviour. It is learning, not
									punishment. Therefore, the consequence must be student-centered and
									situation-appropriate. Staff must consistently respond to behaviour of
									students who have IBSPs according to the strategies outlined in the plan.
									Restorative practises are prioritized in the plan. See the explanatory note
									for indicator 20.2 for further detail on restorative practices.</p>
								<p><strong><u>DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOUR EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Disruptive behaviours are clearly defined. Schools develop intentional
									processes which support effective response to threats or safety
									issues/concerns (e.g., school-based behavior protocols). School personnel
									have received the appropriate training needed to follow the components of
									the established protocols. Communication with families and/or service
									providers is timely. Proactive planning may involve: reviewing or renewing
									plans, post intervention strategies, restorative circles, etc.</p>
								<p>Bullying is defined clearly; students, staff and families can distinguish
									between bullying and other unwanted behaviours &ndash; most students can
									explain the difference between bullying and conflict. Bullying/abuse of
									students based on particular characteristics is recognized and addressed
									specifically (e.g., exceptionalities, sexual minority, gender independent,
									cultural, linguistic and religious minorities, students at risk for
									behavioural issues, and/or students lacking pro-social skills)</p>
								<p><strong><u>LOOK-FORS:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong><em>Conversations</em></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>School personnel, students and families have received information about
										the typical causes of bullying and dynamics of bullies and bullying</li>
									<li>School personnel have received professional learning to equip them to
										proactively prevent/reduce bullying, to address it effectively when it
										happens, seek assistance from resource personnel when needed, and
										follow-up to ensure the situation continues to be under control</li>
									<li>Students and families have been informed of effective ways of preventing
										and responding to bullying. They understand the school&rsquo;s rules,
										approaches and values, and know how to report and request assistance
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong><em>Observations:</em></strong></p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>With this approach, staff members work intentionally to foster learner
									engagement by personalizing learning. Personalization involves developing
									learner agency by promoting autonomy, competence, relatedness, and
									relevance.</p>
								<p>Rooted in Deci and Ryan&rsquo;s work on self-determination and motivation,
									Morrison and Peterson&rsquo;s work on mental fitness, and Marzano,
									Pickering, and Heflebower&rsquo;s work on engagement, the learning through
									personalization (engagement) mindset means fostering learner:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Autonomy &ndash; Learner voice and choice about what, when, how, and
										where they learn and work</li>
									<li>Competence &ndash; Learners have the necessary skills and knowledge to
										complete work successfully (readiness), work within their zone of
										proximal development where rigorous learning happens with scaffolding,
										and work from strengths</li>
									<li>Relatedness &ndash; Learners feel connected with others and a sense of
										belonging</li>
									<li>Relevance &ndash; Learners see their work connected to their interests,
										passions, culture, background, current needs, and future</li>
									<li>Effectively fostering these four components of personalization will
										cultivate engagement which will lead to deeper learning while also
										improving learner agency and resiliency</li>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong><em>Universal Design for Learning </em></strong>(UDL) is the process
									of designing and delivering curricula, materials, and environments in a
									manner that makes them accessible and usable to all students. When teachers
									use the principles associated with UDL, they remove barriers, which
									traditionally have marginalized specific student populations.</p>
								<p>UDL and differentiated instruction are different. UDL is a framework that
									impacts teacher decision making <strong><u>early</u></strong> in the school
									year or during larger unit planning. Teachers apply UDL principles during
									the onset, whereas they use Differentiated Instruction practices during
									daily lesson planning.</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>How teachers design and organize their classroom space</li>
									<li>Varied selection of instructional resources during the unit planning
										stage</li>
									<li>Storage of assessment tools to support student self-access (e.g.,
										checklists, rubrics)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>A teacher may make a variety of graphic organizers available for students to
									select and use before and during the writing process. All students know
									where in the classroom they can access these scaffolds. Not all students
									will need them, but for some, they are critical organizational tools.&nbsp;

									<li><strong> Ideas and information are represented in multiple ways?

								</ol>
								<ul>
									<li>Your course syllabus clearly describes the content and your expectations
										of the students</li>
									<li>You begin each class with an outline of what will be covered</li>

								<ol start="2">
									<li><strong> Students can express their comprehension in multiple ways?
										</strong></li>
								</ol>
								<ul>
									<li>You encourage students to demonstrate knowledge and skills in ways other
										than traditional tests and exams (e.g., written essays, projects,
										portfolios, journals)</li>
									<li>Your assessments measure students&rsquo; achievement of the learning
										objectives, as they are stated on the syllabus</li>
								</ul>
								<ol start="3">

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong>Differentiated instruction </strong>is an approach to instruction
									that maximizes each student&rsquo;s growth by creating multiple paths so
									that students of different abilities, interests, or learning needs
									experience equally appropriate ways to absorb, use and present concepts.</p>
								<p>In a <strong>differentiated classroom</strong>, teachers differentiate
									<strong>content</strong>, <strong>process,</strong> and <strong>product
									</strong>according to students&rsquo; <strong>readiness</strong>,
									<strong>interests</strong> and <strong>learning profiles</strong>.</p>
								<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
								<p>- what the teacher wants the student to learn and the materials or resources
									through which that is accomplished</p>
								<p><strong>Process </strong></p>
								<p>- activities designed to ensure that students use key skills to make sense
									out of essential ideas and information</p>
								<p><strong>Products </strong></p>
								<p>- vehicles through which students demonstrate and extend what they have
									learned</p>
								<p><strong>Readiness </strong></p>
								<p>- a student's entry point relative to a particular understanding or skill</p>
								<p><strong>Learner Profile </strong></p>
								<p>- how an individual student learns</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Differentiate content by <strong>r</strong><strong>eadiness</strong>: A
										lower-leveled text selected for instruction during guided reading as
										appropriate</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Differentiate content by <strong>interests</strong>: All students learn about
									the impact of natural disasters (learning outcome), but, they do this
									through studying self-identified occurrences (e.g., earthquakes, tsunamis,
									volcanic eruptions)</p>

							<div class="header-subsection-text">
								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>The reason for this collaboration is so that each person involved in
									fostering the learning and development of a student can contribute their
									knowledge and expertise to achieve the best results for the student.
									Students are included to the full extent possible, and using language that
									is understood by the student.&nbsp;</p>
								<p><strong><em>See the definition for Personalized Learning Plans (PLP) in the
											explanatory note for indicator 4.2.</em></strong></p>
								<p>Arriving at the decision that a PLP is needed is not a clinical process
									(e.g., does not require a psycho-educational assessment), though it can
									include clinically-based information, depending on the student. The choice
									to enact a PLP for a student will continue to be determined by the school
									ESS Team in consultation with the classroom teacher(s), families, other
									professionals as required and the student as appropriate.</p>
								<p><strong><em>Policy 322 &ndash; Inclusive Education</em></strong></p>
								<p><strong>6.3 Personalized Learning Plan (PLP) </strong></p>
								<p>6.3.1 Students must receive a Personalized Learning Plan when one or more of
									the following conditions exist:</p>
								<p>1) Strategies beyond robust instruction are required.</p>
								<p>2) Behavioural supports, as outlined in section 6.6 of <em>Policy 703 &ndash;
										Positive Learning and Working Environment</em>, are required.</p>
								<p>3) The common learning environment is to be varied in accordance with section
									6.4 of this policy.</p>
								<p>6.3.2 A principal must ensure:</p>
								<p>1) A PLP is developed by a planning team consisting of the school
									administration, teacher(s), relevant members of the Education Support
									Services (ESS) Team, as well as families, the student, and educational
									assistants as appropriate, and support people from community organizations
									as required.</p>
								<p>6.3.3 Classroom teachers must:</p>
								<p>4) Ensure lesson plans and instructional strategies reflect the requirements
									of the PLP.</p>
								<p><strong><u>LOOK FOR:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong><em>Products:</em></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>A section is included in the lesson plan with guiding questions or notes
										that assist the teacher to differentiate on an ongoing basis in relation
										to the PLPs of students in the class. This could also be accomplished by
										using a folder with lesson plans/components for students who have a PLP
									</li>
									<li>Collaboration is indicated in the PLP by the presence of signatures,
										successive meeting dates, etc.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong><em>Conversations:</em></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>In in keeping with their age and abilities, students have input into
										their PLP and can speak to the content</li>
									<li>Families indicate they have been involved in the planning of the PLP and
										understand the PLP goals</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong><em>Observations:</em></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>PLPs/PLP goals are consulted daily by the subject teacher and EA(s) as
										applicable</li>
									<li>Subject teachers and EST-R meet to discuss student progress and ways to
										adjust lesson plans to better address students needs</li>
									<li>Educational Assistants are never the primary instructors of any student,
										nor are they primarily responsible for developing lesson plans for any
										student (<em>Creating an Inclusive School Culture</em>, NBACL, 2011,
										page 56).</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Please note a change in the accepted terminology: Adjusted Curricular
									Outcomes and goals were formerly known as a Modified PLPs.</p>

								<p><strong>NB Curricula </strong>support critical literacy skills. Students must

								<p><strong>Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy</strong> provides an important framework for

									student work.</p>
								<p>The taxonomy identifies six levels of <strong>Critical Thinking which
									</strong>can be used in the classroom to help develop all levels of thinking
									within the cognitive domain. The results will be improved attention to
									detail, increased comprehension and expanded problem-solving skills. The six
									levels are:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Knowledge</li>
									<li>Comprehension</li>
									<li>Application</li>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong>This approach would include staff members working intentionally to
										foster an environment which includes Personalization of Learning.
									</strong>Personalization involves promoting self-directed learning (student
									agency, autonomy, voice and choice) while working to achieve the New
									Brunswick Global Competencies.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Utilizing Deci and Ryan&rsquo;s approach, staff members adopt a mindset
									focused on engaging students and peers in the process of learning. This
									would include a focus on:&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Competence &ndash; using Vygotsky&rsquo;s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD),
									the pedagogical environment focuses on scaffolding, mastery learning,
									readiness, and strength-based approaches</p>
								<p>Autonomy &ndash; promoting student voice, choice, and agency</p>
								<p>Relatedness &ndash; includes identifying student interests, linking to prior
									knowledge, and using student choice to facilitate student engagement (Deci
									&amp; Ryan, 2000)</p>
								<p>Relevance &ndash; includes promoting topics of interest to the students which
									also have relevance to the real world. Authentic learning, identifying real
									world application, and helping students identify social and cultural
									significance (Ferlazzo, 2017a &amp; Ferlazzo, 2017 b)</p>
								<p>Effectively working toward these four components of personalized learning
									will help build student capacity, which in turn helps cultivate resilience
									and self-determination in learners.&nbsp;</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<p>In order to foster connectedness adults in the school intentionally take an
									interest in each student&rsquo;s academic work, behaviour and sense of
									belonging.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Students feel that teachers and staff assist them when they need help. School
									personnel foster a caring atmosphere, which is used to promote
									connectedness. Building student resilience is one of the core school
									principles. This could include the use of a<strong><em>dvisory/advocacy
											programs: </em>&nbsp;a</strong>rrangements whereby adults and small
									groups of students have the opportunity to interact on a regularly scheduled
									basis in order to foster a caring environment which focuses on guidance and
									support as well as providing a forum for student voice.</p>
								<p>Fostering connectedness could also include the <em>Relational Management
										Approach</em> outlined in &ldquo;<em>From</em> <em>Silo&rsquo;s to
										Systems&rdquo;</em> whereby:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Teachers know student&rsquo;s names and take time to chat with them
										outside of classrooms</li>
									<li>Teachers know something about students in classes and check in with them
										about recent events in their lives</li>
									<li>Teachers convey confidence in a student&rsquo;s future</li>
									<li>Teacher show concern when students are absent (Kilgore and Reynolds,
										2012, pg. 98)</li>

							<div class="header-subsection-text">
								<p><strong><u>DEFINITION:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong>Metacognition </strong>is the process of thinking about one&rsquo;s
									own thought processes. Pressley, M. (2003) defines metacognition as<em>
										knowledge of the thinking processes. </em>&nbsp;It is &ldquo;knowing
									about knowing&rdquo; or &ldquo;thinking about thinking. &ldquo;It is that
									&lsquo;inner voice&rsquo; that helps one solves problems, strategize, and
									self-evaluate performance. Metacognition occurs in the here and now as
									students decide on how to solve problems or complete tasks. Students have
									developed metacognitive skills when they are able to answer the question,
									<strong>&ldquo;How has your thinking changed?&rdquo; </strong></p>
								<p>Metacognitive skills enable the monitoring of one&rsquo;s own learning.
									Self-regulation of learning involves the learner being aware when they are
									and are not comprehending text or the task at hand and strategizing how to
									respond to this awareness.</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Reciprocal Teaching </strong>is a strategy of metacognitive
										skill teaching, where the teacher models application of a reading
										strategy (predicting, questioning, summarizing, and clarifying) through
										their own think-aloud of why and how they apply the strategy. Students
										are then expected to begin to go through the process themselves.</li>
									<li>Questions that are designed to guide student thinking when they are
										thinking about <strong>Parts of a Whole</strong>:</li>
								</ul>
								<ol>
									<li>What are the smaller parts that make up the whole?</li>
									<li>What would happen if each part was missing?</li>
									<li>What is the function of each part?</li>
									<li>How do the parts work together to make the whole do what it does?</li>
								</ol>
								<ul>
									<li>Prompting students to use <strong>Skillful Decision-Making</strong>
										serves to shift the center of gravity in the classroom away from a
										teacher-centered model to an active student-centered model. One could
										(1) break the students into &ldquo;collaborative thinking groups&rdquo;
										each with specific thinking tasks that contribute to the overall
										process, (2) provide them with various graphics that serve as reflection
										and recording devices for their thinking, and (3) provide oral guidance
										for them as they work through the thinking map for skillful decision
										making. This example takes students to a different thinking level than
										&ldquo;what choice is best&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; questions.
										Questions to support Skillful Decision-Making include:</li>
								</ul>
								<ol>
									<li>What makes a decision necessary?</li>
									<li>What are my options?</li>
									<li>What are the likely consequences of these options?</li>
									<li>How important are these consequences?</li>
									<li>What&rsquo;s the best option in light of the consequences?</li>
								</ol>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Articulating Strategy Selection and Use</strong> in any
										curricular area is an example of a metacognitive process It is important
										to get students to stand back from content-related thinking to engage in
										various types of metacognition. One could start with the students
										identifying the kind of thinking they just engaged in, then describing
										how they did it, and then asking, &ldquo;Was this a good way to do this
										kind of thinking?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Does the procedure need modification.
										If so, how, and then, how can this be turned into an explicit plan for
										doing the same sort of thinking again?&rdquo;</li>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Teachers use a variety of classroom structures to support student
									learning&nbsp;(e.g., Writer&rsquo;s Workshop Model, Book Studies,
									Project-Based Learning). As Wilhelm (2007) explains both Problem- and
									Project-based Learning structures can be used as the method of learning
									during a large one-month unit (e.g., What makes a good relationship?) or as
									part of a teacher&rsquo;s pedagogy during a lesson.&nbsp;</p>
								<p><strong>Problem-based Learning (PBL)</strong> is a student-centered pedagogy
									in which students learn about a subject in the context of complex,
									multifaceted and realistic problems. Working in groups, students identify
									what they already know, what they need to know, and how and where to access
									new information that may lead to resolution of the problem. The role of the
									instructor is that of facilitator of learning who provides appropriate
									scaffolding of that process by: asking probing questions, providing
									appropriate resources, and leading class discussions, as well as designing
									student assessments.</p>
								<p>The six core characteristics of Problem-based learning:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Consists of student-centered learning</li>
									<li>Learning occurs in small groups</li>
									<li>Teachers act as facilitators or guides</li>
									<li>A problem forms the basis for organized focus and stimulus for learning
									</li>
									<li>Problems stimulate the development and use of problem-solving
										skills&nbsp;</li>
									<li>New knowledge is obtained through means of self-directed learning</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The Seven C&rsquo;s of Project Based Learning:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Curriculum</strong>: the starting point for PBL development is
										always learning outcomes from official provincial curriculum.</li>
									<li><strong>Competencies</strong>: along with meeting knowledge content
										outcomes, competencies are also instructed and assessed.</li>
									<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: the final product, presentation, and/or
										exhibition is deliberately designed to be a task, or group of tasks,
										that cannot be completed by one individual but requires meaningful
										participation from all members of a high-performing team. Thus, a
										genuine need for collaboration is presented to students.</li>
									<li><strong>Current</strong>: the driving question frames the learning by
										presenting a current, real-world problem to be solved - one that is
										taken seriously by adults engaged in similar work.</li>
									<li><strong>Community</strong>: where possible, to provide utmost relevance
										for students, expert assistance for teachers, and authentic assessment
										opportunity, the issue or problem should be based in the local
										community.</li>
									<li><strong>Connected Students</strong>: should be able to connect to the
										question to be answered; they should see the value in their work beyond
										just getting a final mark.</li>
									<li><strong>Cool!</strong> A great PBL engages students right from the
										beginning with a launch activity (the &ldquo;grabber&rdquo;) designed to
										capture their interest followed by the introduction of a PBL
										&ldquo;briefcase&rdquo; which includes rubrics for assessment, a list of
										resources, project milestones, final presentation schedules, etc. so
										that there is clarity of expectations, and thus a sense of
										&ldquo;do-ability&rdquo; and accomplishment for the student.</li>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Students should work collaboratively towards one common goal, in both

										of the group contributing and comprehending</strong> (e.g., book
									studies, reciprocal teaching, Project-based Learning). After students
									receive high-impact instruction, they spend time practicing the skills, both
									independently and collaboratively. In-class observations should note a ratio
									of 20% teacher voice and 80% student voice. Students are also provided with
									frequent, less formal, opportunities to collaborate (e.g., peer

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>In high performing schools, teachers use available technology <em>in meaningful ways</em> to engage students in their learning. This indicator <em>is not</em> referring to the amount of technology that is available (i.e., all classrooms being equipped with SMARTBoards or the school having several computer labs in operation) <em>nor is it</em> referring to the frequency of integrating technology in instruction. Rather, the emphasis here is on how technology is being effectively used by teachers to promote student learning.</p>
								<p><strong>Questions to consider:</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Are we maximizing our use of technology (e.g. online tools) to ensure we are engaging all learners (Couros 2015)?</li>
									<li>Is the teacher using the technology effectively (e.g. SMART Board as a traditional blackboard or projector or as a means of providing students with relevant, interactive learning experiences?</li>
									<li>Are computers being used as a means for student self-directed learning opportunities (e.g., Web-Quests, Blogs, online modules, free online courses, online science and math resources). <strong><u>See below for some online resources.</u></strong></li>
									<li>How does using the technology enhance learning experiences for students?</li>
									<li>Is technology being leveraged to support effective use of teacher time, to allow for better focusing of available time to help students. For example, recording videos to help students with common issues, computer grading for multiple choice questions.</li>
									<li>Is technology being leveraged to support student self-assessment and self-reporting of learning, students creating and producing information, and collaborating online with others. (e.g. blogs, video logs, collaborative tools for dialogue, video, music, etc.)</li>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION: </u></strong></p>
								<p>Literacy remains one of the most important aspects of education and is a
									strong predictor of student success as adults. As Moore (1999) states,
									&ldquo;Adolescents entering the adult world in the 21st century will read
									and write more than at any other time in human history. They will need
									advanced levels of literacy to perform their jobs, run their households, act
									as citizens, and conduct their personal lives. They will need literacy to
									cope with the flood of information they will find everywhere they
									turn&rdquo; (Moore, p.3).&nbsp;</p>
								<p>The N.B Look-for document notes four critical aspects of effective literacy
									instruction and supporting elements:</p>
								<p><strong>Classroom Environment</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Cross-curricular literacy</li>
									<li>Literacy materials</li>
									<li>Community atmosphere</li>
									<li>Print rich environment</li>
									<li>Classroom arrangement</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Student Activities</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Ownership and personal engagement</li>
									<li>Speaking, listening, and language</li>
									<li>Daily opportunities for reading/viewing</li>
									<li>Daily opportunities for writing/representing</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Teacher Activities</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Assessment informs instruction</li>
									<li>Planning and preparation</li>
									<li>Differentiated instructional practice</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Balanced Components</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Word work</li>
									<li>Oral language</li>
									<li>Modeled writing</li>
									<li>Shared writing</li>
									<li>Independent writing</li>
									<li>Read aloud</li>
									<li>Shared reading</li>
									<li>Guided reading</li>
									<li>Independent reading</li>
								</ul>
								<p>&ldquo;Observations should evidence planning and instruction featuring
									seamless and meaningful connections between components (Moore, 1999, p.3).

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Quality curricula and instruction, and authentic experiences are used to
									promote the acquisition and appreciation of additional languages.</p>
								<p><strong><em>Multiculturalism</em></strong> can be defined, in the Canadian
									context, as the recognition, accommodation and celebration of difference,
									with the goal of unity and belonging for all. Plurilingualism is the
									celebration of the ability of a person who has competence in more than one
									language, to be able to draw on whichever language fits the situation best.
									It is different than multilingualism, which could be explained as having
									multiple languages, that sit side-by-side (not intertwined) and are used for
									separate purposes. <strong><em>Plurilingualism</em></strong>, on the other
									hand, recognizes that an individual may switch from language to language
									according to the situation. In fact, plurilinguals use one language or
									another interchangeably, according to the situation, because the languages
									we learn are all mixed together in our development, not in neat boxes
									separate from the others. A plurilingual is afforded a way of understanding
									the world and its many cultures through languages; the gap between people
									and cultures is minimized.</p>
								<p>Plurilingualism is tied to pluricultural competence, which is tied, in some
									ways, to the Canadian understanding of multiculturalism. Pluricultural
									competence is the recognition (personally and individually) that exchange
									and meditation between cultures and through languages is what brings about
									true multiculturalism.</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>&ldquo;Communication&rdquo; in French and additional language classes refers
									to the instruction, dialogue and conversation that occurs during class time.
									The use of French should be observed on the part of teachers and students.
								</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLE:</u></strong></p>
								<p>During French and additional language classes, students should converse in
									the language during formal and informal sharing opportunities and during
									general dialogue with others (e.g., when asking to borrow an eraser from a
									peer).</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXCEPTION: </u></strong></p>
								<p>In English as an Additional Language (EAL), students, at times, will need to
									converse in a shared home language (if available) to ensure they understand
									the content and next steps. Additionally, research shows that it is
									important when working with newcomer populations who are asked to function
									in English all day, to show a valuing of the home language and culture when
									possible. Therefore, at times, students in EAL class may be asked to share
									with the class &ldquo;how to say this word&rdquo; in their home language, or
									what &ldquo;x concept&rdquo; means in their culture. This valuing of
									plurilingualism adds to students&rsquo; sense of safety and belonging in the
									classroom, which will in turn boost their achievement in the learning of the
									additional language.</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong>There are seven key processes which are the foundation of our Mathematics curriculum:</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Encourage students to&nbsp;estimate prior to calculations to predict solutions and afterwards determine if their solution is reasonable</li>
									<li>Communication</li>
									<li>Connections</li>
									<li>Problem-solving</li>
									<li>Reasoning</li>
									<li>Mental math and estimation</li>
									<li>Technology and visualization</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong>To support numeracy development, teachers across the curriculum can:</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Explore and encourage discussions regarding patterns which can be found in all subject areas (e.g., music rhythm, data from science investigations, poetry, art design, statistics in social studies, etc.)</li>
									<li>Encourage students to solve problems with calculations in a variety of ways depending on the numbers involved (e.g., mental math, paper/pencil, calculators)</li>
									<li>Use the same conventions for reading and writing numbers as done in mathematics classes (e.g., 6145.38 does not include a comma to separate the thousands and hundreds places and it is read as six thousand, one hundred, forty-five <u>and</u> thirty-eight hundredths</li>
									<li>Use measurement skills and units that are grade appropriate according to the mathematics curriculum (e.g., centimetre, metre, kilometre, gram, kilogram, millilitre, litre)</li>
									<li>Use and discuss a variety of data displays and have students create their own based on what is grade-appropriate. Students need to be able to read and interpret a variety of charts, graphs, and other displays</li>
									<li>Encourage students to&nbsp;estimate prior to calculations to predict solutions and after to determine if their solution is reasonable</li>
									<li>Demonstrate that they believe all students can learn math and the teacher models a positive attitude toward learning</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Many connections to math in other subject areas can be made, including the following:</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Numbers: reading and writing numbers appropriately (34 650 is written without a comma and is read as thirty-four thousand six hundred fifty; 7.09 is read as seven and nine thousandths)</li>
									<li>Calculations: encourage the use of mental math and estimation</li>
									<li>Patterns (stories, poetry, results of investigations, art designs, music, etc.)</li>
									<li>Measurement (units of measurement, distances, mass, area, volume, time, rate, speed, etc.)</li>
									<li>Geometry (names of polygons and 3-D objects, symmetry, grids, tiling/tessellations, etc.)</li>
									<li>Graphing: collecting, organizing, displaying, and interpreting data</li>
									<li>Mapping: grids, ratios, location</li>
									<li>Proportion</li>
									<li>Math terminology in other subject areas (heart rate, metre, pentagon, etc.)</li>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>&ldquo;Capable learners are literate as they have the capacity to interpret, understand, and create texts. A text is a framework people use to communicate with one another and consists of anything that conveys a set of meanings to the person who examines it. A text is not just the written word&mdash;other examples include an oral story, a musical score, a piece of art, a mathematical equation, a dance, a chemical formula, a game, a network of linked web pages, an advertisement, a video, and an outfit. Capable learners have the literacy to interact with various forms of texts as this is foundational to solving problems, creating new ideas, thinking critically, collaborating, and communicating.&rdquo; (Portrait of a Learner p. 11)</p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Assessments are purpose-driven. Teachers understand the purpose of the assessment. In order to decide the appropriate type of assessment, they first determine whether they are: planning learning, supporting learning, monitoring learning or verifying learning. They subsequently choose the appropriate assessment for the purpose and determine next steps in instruction.</p>
								<p>Schools should have a well-defined process to collect and examine evidence, including formative and summative assessments, which inform progress toward identified school goals, identify needs, planning and goal development, to assist schools to effectively allocate resources and plan based on PL needs.</p>
								<p><strong><u>DEFINITION:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong>Formative assessment</strong> practices include<strong> frequent</strong>, interactive assessments of student progress and comprehension. Often defined as assessment for learning, formative assessment is an ongoing, dynamic process. Formative assessment takes place during the learning process when both the teacher and the student can make decisions towards promoting further learning.</p>
								<p><strong>Summative assessment</strong> is used <strong>periodically</strong> as a means to determine a student&rsquo;s mastery and understanding of information, skills, concepts, or processes and serves as a summary of performance. Often defined as assessment of learning, summative assessment is used to make a judgment, such as what grade a student will receive, or to determine whether a particular program was effective.</p>

								<li>Where am I going?</li>
								<li>How can I close the gap between where I am now and where I want to go?</li>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong><br /> The key to <strong>effective learning feedback</strong> is that it is both timely and meaningful. In order to ensure students have the opportunity to establish effective learning goals and priorities, they need to receive feedback that is targeted on specific strengths and challenges. This feedback needs to be shared in a timely manner. For example, brief (three-minute) teacher/student writing conferences could hone-in on one thing that is working for the student and one thing that needs attention. Feedback can be written or oral. The student should be able to identify her or his next steps, based on the feedback provided.&nbsp;</p>
								<p><strong><u>DEFINITION:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong>Goal-Referenced Feedback </strong></p>
								<p>Students need reminders about goals and the criteria by which they should self-assess. For example, a teacher might say, &ldquo;The point of this writing task is to make the reader laugh. So, when rereading your draft, or getting feedback from peers, ask, &ldquo;How funny is this? Where might it be funnier?&rdquo; (Wiggins, 2012).</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Modelling peer assessment strategies so that students provide ongoing feedback to each other about their work</li>
									<li>Inviting other teachers/students/people from the field to come visit the classroom and provide students feedback on their work</li>
									<li>Giving written feedback about strengths/needs when assessing student work (doesn&rsquo;t always have to be a grade)</li>
									<li>Modeling or explaining next steps for improving student work</li>
									<li>Achievement (e.g., writing) continuums could be used for student to self-asses and set personal learning targets</li>

								<p>Dedicated time for student reflection should be observable in lesson planning and practice. Students should have ongoing formal and informal opportunities to share what they have learned and how their thinking has changed.</p>
								<p>Ongoing opportunities for consolidation of learning include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Response journaling</li>
									<li>Learning logs</li>
									<li>Exit slips</li>
									<li>Double-entry diaries</li>
									<li>Student-led portfolios: collection and reflection of how selected products represent their learning</li>
								</ul>
								<p>When using<strong> Workshop Model</strong>, the lesson ends with dedicated time for a diversity of reflection, introspection, sharing and metacognitive self-analysis. These opportunities can occur on a whole class, small group, partner, or an individual basis. Teacher observation can be used to gauge comprehension and determine whether there is a necessity to adjust the instruction, re-teach in small group or whole class, or accelerate the rate and pace of learning.</p>
								<p>Self-assessment and peer-assessment provides time for students to process and learn. When teachers engage students in this, they give students time to:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Process and learn</li>
									<li>Share ideas with others</li>
									<li>Self-reflect on their learning</li>
									<li>Provide others with constructive feedback</li>

								<p><strong><em>Flexible instructional grouping</em></strong> is an instructional strategy whereby teachers use evidence of learning to group and regroup students to help promote engagement, accentuate learner strengths and share student&rsquo;s expertise with peers, therefore advancing learning for all. Diverse groupings can occur within the common learning environment, within classrooms, and between classrooms, or in virtual learning spaces. Groupings are fluid and are adjusted regularly based on data and evidence and student need<em>. Some key principles of effective flexible groupings include</em></p>
								<ol>
									<li>There are blended learning components to support student independence (technology)</li>
									<li>Student agency is promoted (systemically) and encouraged (individually &ndash; teacher and student)</li>
									<li>Placements are based on knowledge of, and the best interests of, the students</li>
									<li>Placements are short-term, varied and inclusive</li>
									<li>Student agency (voice and choice) is at the forefront of flexible learning and personalization</li>

								<p><strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong></p>
								<p><strong><em>Ongoing Review</em></strong></p>
								<p>For this indicator, &ldquo;ongoing review&rdquo; means the frequency of review is appropriate for the learning outcomes. More frequent review may be needed when working on outcomes for which the student&rsquo;s speed of progress is difficult to predict. This may also be the case when there are unforeseen changes to the learning environment or the learner&rsquo;s situation (e.g., Outcome: student is working on applying co-developed strategies for self-regulating aggressive verbal responses &ndash; Situation: student&rsquo;s home situation changes when she is placed in a foster home).</p>
								<p>The frequency of availability of the data and evidence required to assess progress also impacts the ability to review goals and outcomes. Reviewing the PLP requires the teacher&rsquo;s time. When planning the goal/outcome, and its corresponding evidence of learning, choose the most meaningful evidence and reflect on the least labour-intensive manner in which it can be obtained.</p>

								<p><strong><u>DEFINITION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>The <strong><em>Education Support Teacher-Resource (EST-Resource), New Brunswick Knowledge and Skills Document</em> (2010)</strong> identifies expectations for collaboration as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Uses models and strategies of consultation and collaboration</li>
									<li>Consults and collaborates in administrative and instructional decisions at the school</li>
									<li>Understands the roles of individuals with exceptional learning needs, families, and school and community personnel in planning of personalized programs</li>
									<li>Fosters respectful and beneficial relationships between families and professionals</li>

								</ul>

								<p><strong>Policy 322 and Allocation of Time:</strong></p>
								<p>Resource Education Support Teachers must direct a minimum of 60% of available time (FTE) over the course of the school year, directly supporting and collaborating with classroom teachers. (Policy 322) Supports include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Classroom observation and feedback (teacher self-identified support) *</li>
									<li>Co-planning of instruction</li>
									<li>Co-teaching *</li>
									<li>Initiation and supporting instructional strategies</li>
									<li>Problem solving</li>
									<li>Modeling *</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>*</strong> Essential to each of these types of supports, are intentional pre- and post-support conversations. For example, before an EST models a specific pedagogical approach, the EST and teacher should decide upon the lesson &ldquo;look fors.&rdquo; After modeling, the EST and teacher should discuss what the teacher learned, and how the teacher will apply the learning to lesson planning, instruction and assessment practices.</p>
								<p>Resource Education Support Teachers may direct a maximum of 25% of time on direct instruction or intervention with small groups of children, and occasionally, with individual students, but in all cases with specific entry and exit criteria, and documentation of outcomes achieved. (Policy 322) Essential<strong> to this student support, is EST and teacher collaborative planning and monitoring of student skill development.</strong></p>

								<p><strong><u>EXPLANATION:</u></strong></p>
								<p>In high performing schools, leaders, staff members and teams seek the guidance and support of available subject-area coordinators, leads, and specialists on a routine basis in order to foster expertise in instructional practices and pedagogy.</p>
								<p>Teams collaboratively identify EST/subject-area coordinator support as a resource to support the identified achievement goals. Action items in meeting minutes reflect EST/subject-area coordinator involvement, follow-up, PL or support.</p>
								<p><strong><u>EXAMPLES:</u></strong></p>
								<p>Support for targeted, job-embedded professional learning includes:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>In-class instructional coaching (e.g., modeling of specific, pre-identified pedagogy)</li>
									<li>Common planning time (CPT), PLC, grade-level team meetings (e.g., data analysis)</li>
									<li>ESS Team meetings</li>
									<li>Staff-wide professional learning opportunities (e.g., portion of each monthly staff meeting, school-based PL day session)</li>
									<li>Teacher/EST/subject-area coordinator emails, phone calls, and hallway conversations</li>
									<li>ESTs and subject area coordinators are aware of school achievement trends, existing instructional practices, and next professional learning steps</li>
