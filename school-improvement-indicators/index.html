				The desire for a consistent improvement planning framework for schools was
				identified by means of two major consultations. The first was a consultation
				which focused on the 10-year Education Plan implementation. The 10-year
				Education Plan Implementation Committee, which consisted of early childhood
				educators, representatives from the New Brunswick Teachers’ Association,
				First Nation educators, families, principals, classroom teachers, and
				education system leaders, led consultations with over 4800 participants.
				When the team submitted their recommendations, the overarching request from
				the system was to establish clear expectations for implementing the 10-year
				Education Plan.

				<br><br>

				The second consultation was system-wide and occurred between November 24th
				and December 1st, 2017. This took into consideration the views of educators
				working on the front lines and included 2497 individual and school
				submissions. Ongoing consultations, including focus groups and individual
				dialogues have occurred regularly following the larger consultations. From
				these consultations the desire for a consistent improvement framework to be
				used provincially throughout the four Anglophone School Districts was
				identified. Suggestions for content to be included in the Improvement
				Framework were also gathered from these systemic consultations.

				The domains are ordered hierarchically. The classroom environment operates
				within the broader learning environment, which operates within the
				leadership and teaming environment, which operates to carry out the
				overarching School Improvement Plan (SIP) and Positive Learning and Working
				Environment Plan (PLWEP) goals and their strategies, and the same logic
				operates in reverse.
				<br><br>
				The four domains are one way of grouping related practices to more easily
				see them as processes within a system. Practices at each level affect/inform
				those at higher and lower levels, so the degree to which they are
				intentionally aligned will impact effectiveness.
				<br><br>
				This does not mean all indicators in Domains I – III must be addressed
				before tackling <i>Classroom Practice</i>, or that indicators in any domain
				are more important than others.

						<h4 style="font-style:normal">Recommended Process for Self-Assessment</h4>
						Review of the guiding questions at the beginning of each domain, in
						conjunction with school-based evidence (e.g., Teacher Perception Survey
						Data, OurSchool and Student Wellness Survey data, meeting minutes,
						existing SIP and PLWEP monitoring data) will help to identify the domains
						or subdomains for initial focus.
						<br><br>
						Once the domain or subdomains of interest are identified, school
						improvement teams are encouraged to review the associated indicators and
						sub-indicators. An initial discussion of these with reference to the
						evidence/data already reviewed will help to determine which indicators and
						sub-indicators warrant deep analysis. Deep analysis is based on
						triangulation of evidence. This will increase the reliability of the
						self-assessment.
						<br><br>
						To assist with interpretation of the indicators, please refer to the NB
						School Improvement Indicators with Explanatory Notes document. This
						document provides further explanation of the rationale/practices
						supporting each indicator and/or the associated research. This will
						support the effective rating of indicators.
						<br><br>
						Schools that are developing a new SIP are encouraged to work through all
						the indicators.

					When discussing indicator ratings, school teams are urged to be mindful of
					the purpose of this document as a vehicle for formative dialogue. The value
					of the discussion lies in coming to agreement on the current situation, and
					establishing priorities for focused action, not the rating.
				</strong>

				<br><br>
				The labels for the ratings are: <b><i>Very Evident (VE), Mostly Evident
						(ME), Somewhat Evident (SE) and Not Evident (NE).</i></b>

				<br><br>

				<table style="border: none; margin-left:3em; line-height:1;">

						<td style="padding-bottom:0.5em; border: none;"><b>VE:</b></td>
						<td style="padding-bottom:0.5em; border: none;">You’ve nailed it – keep

							consistent practice)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="padding-bottom:0.5em; border: none;"><b>ME:</b></td>
						<td style="padding-bottom:0.5em; border: none;">You have processes and

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="padding-bottom:0.5em; border: none;"><b>SE:</b></td>
						<td style="padding-bottom:0.5em; border: none;">You have a plan and a step

						<td style="padding-bottom:0.5em; border: none;">You haven’t considered it

				<br>
				The following is proposed as a guide for determining ratings. Only Very
				Evident is defined. This approach was chosen in order to avoid inflexible
				rubrics while providing sufficient guidance to support uniform rating
				decisions.
				<br><br>
				<div class="rcorners">

							knowledge, skills, data, and ongoing monitoring and adjustment are
							required for this are in place).</i></b>
				</div>
				<br>
				<b>Questions to consider when using a rating of <u>Very Evident</u>:</b>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Is this part of the way we do business
						(pervasive, routine, part of the school culture)?</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Would this survive if the leadership
						changed?</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Is there a process for induction of new
						staff members?</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Is this a school-wide approach?</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Is it consistently demonstrated by staff –
						or just pockets of staff, or certain groups of staff?</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Is it documented with data/evidence or
						artifacts?</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Would your staff be able to explain/speak
						to this practice?</li>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0.3em">Are staff members willing to share this
						practice with others or have others come to your school or class to
						observe?</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<b>Note:</b> Indicators are rated by triangulating evidence from a variety
				of sources including observations, conversations and products.

								<u><b>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>School leadership teams consult a range of data/evidence to identify
									a limited number of school goals/areas of focus (i.e. not exceeding
									five) for improvement. Continuous improvement planning includes and
									supports the social-emotional, physical, cultural, and academic
									inclusion and growth of all learners. Teacher teams further analyze
									evidence of learning to identify the root causes of achievement gaps,
									develop one to two learning targets (i.e. SMART goals), design
									actions, and implement interventions. Leadership teams monitor team
									progress towards their targets as well as collective growth towards
									the global priorities. Strategic school initiatives, including
									responsive professional learning, are implemented to support
									continuous improvement.</p>
								<p>SMART refers to goals that are: Strategic, Measurable,
									Action-oriented, Realistic and Time-bound. Although there are multiple
									versions of the SMART acronym including the original definition by
									George T. Doran (1981), this version most easily lends itself to
									School Improvement Planning. All goals should be action oriented and
									strategies should lead to progress towards addressing identified
									learning targets. For schools who may find the SMART goal approach
									challenging, please work to address two priorities when establishing
									data: 1. Present Level of Performance (PLOP), and 2. ongoing
									monitoring to ensure progress towards identified goals.</p>
								<p>Teams use PLOP to identify an area of focus/school goal. Through
									data analysis, a learning target(s) is created. (e.g., By December
									15th, 18 of 22 of our grade 3 students will begin sentences in
									different ways and write different sentence lengths.) Only 2-3 actions
									should be identified, each of which are expected to impact the measure
									(e.g., sentence structure “Write Trait”).</p>
								<p>Effective goals contain measures (i.e. what the students have
									learned). Provincial assessment scores and term-based report card
									ratings are not reasonable measures. Appropriate measures are based
									upon a combination of varied sources of evidence of student learning.
									For example, the measure in the above-mentioned learning target is
									different sentence beginnings and lengths.</p>
								<p>Effective goals also allow teams to plan and implement actions
									strategically. They also promote the importance of monitoring to
									ensure teams are moving in the right direction to be successful in
									achieving the desired results.</p>
								<p>Effective goals are based upon short time frames (e.g., four to six
									weeks) that create a practical sense of urgency between the current
									reality and the preferred future. Teams regularly review the learning
									target(s), relevant data and identify which students are progressing
									toward and/or meeting the goal(s), and plan interventions for students
									who are not developing the required skills (e.g., EST-R provided tier
									2 in-class academic interventions).</p>

								<b><u>EXPLANATION:</u></b>
								<p>In order to understand the impact of professional learning on

									students.</p>

								<p><b>LEVEL 1: Participant Reaction:</b> Did they like it? Was their
									time well spent? Did the materials make sense? Was it useful?</p>
								<p><b>LEVEL 2: Participant Learning:</b> Did participants acquire the
									intended knowledge and skills?</p>
								<p><b>LEVEL 3: Organization Support & Change:</b> What was the impact
									on the organization? Was implementation advocated, facilitated and
									supported? Were problems addressed quickly? Were sufficient resources
									made available?</p>
								<p><b>LEVEL 4: Participants’ Use of New Knowledge and Skill:</b> Were
									new knowledge and skills effectively applied? What evidence?</p>
								<p><b>LEVEL 5: Student Learning Outcome: What was the impact on
										students?</b> Did it affect student achievement? Is student
									attendance changing? Are dropouts decreasing? Are students more
									confident learners?</p>

								<b><u>EXAMPLES:</u></b>

								<b><u>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>Student achievement data refers to school-based assessments,

									should gather and monitor assessment data frequently to provide
									support for teaching and learning.</p>
								<p>Staff members and teams are encouraged to drill down into the data
									to identify the root causes of issues or challenges.</p>

								<b><u>EXAMPLES:</b></u>
								<p>Some examples of routine gathering and monitoring data include:</p>

								</ul>

								<p>Provincial data should be closely monitored by staff to determine
									longitudinal trends of cohorts of students. Staff should use this data
									to compare to district and provincial trends.</p>
								<p>Teachers should be aware of weighting and other test characteristics
									of provincial assessments which are described in testing specification
									documents, typically found in the appendix of the assessment.
									Awareness of this information will help schools to plan and support
									school-wide interventions.</p>

								<p>The intent of this indicator is to ensure data use for the
									monitoring of important school goals, where the direct outcome is
									something other than an increase in assessment results (e.g.,
									social-emotional, physical, and cultural growth). For example, Our
									School data and informal discussions with at-risk students suggest
									that increased social engagement could improve attendance and
									eventually achievement of a group of marginalized students. Question
									schools could consider:</p>
								<ul class="indented-list">
									<li>What is the behaviour you wish to impact directly?</li>
									<li>How will you be able to tell? What data will be collected?</li>
									<li>What is your baseline (Present Level of Performance)?</li>
								</ul>

								<br>

								<p>Observations and anecdotal information need to be turned into
									“trackable” data.
									<br>Data sources could include:</p>
								<ul class="indented-list">
									<li>Our School data</li>
									<li>School-generated student/family/staff survey data</li>
									<li>Observable strategies</li>
									<li>Powerschool data</li>
									<li>Participation in student-driven initiatives (e.g., student-led
										fundraising, working with senior citizens, co-op opportunities,
										volunteering, Student Representative Council (SRC) and other
										co-curricular activities)</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								<p><b>Stretch Learning is defined</b> as the demonstration of rigorous
									and relevant learning beyond minimum requirements.… for educators
									stretch learning means providing active rigorous and relevant learning
									conditions for students “within the content area” … For students
									stretch learning provides frequent opportunities in every school
									setting to go beyond the basic requirements and access the resources
									and technology to demonstrate that learning (Stretch Learning,
									International Center for Leadership, p.1). Stretch learning
									opportunities are focused on advancing learning opportunities within
									the content area as opposed to enrichment which is broader in that it
									is not limited to the topic or area of study.</p>
								<br>
								<p><b>Some of the most effective ways to offer stretch learning
										opportunities for advanced students are:</b></p>
								<ul class="indented-list">
									<li>Increased student choice</li>
									<li>Peer learning opportunities</li>
									<li>Project-based learning</li>
									<li>Problem-based learning</li>
									<li>High interest/experiential learning</li>
									<li>Bloom’s Taxonomy/higher order questioning techniques</li>
									<li>Tiered activities</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								<b><u>EXAMPLE:</u></b>
								<p>Analysis of <i>Our School</i> (playground info and change) student
									perception survey data may lead a team to identify student social
									engagement as an area of focus in their School Improvement Plan.
									During the delivery of varied opportunities to support personal and
									leadership skill development (e.g., Peer Helpers, sports programming,
									Student Leadership Council), Alpha Stars students could complete
									surveys which allow the team to measure their impact on student
									development of these skills.</p>

								<b><u>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>To ensure that academic interventions are school-wide and systematic
									in scope, design and practice, effective schools establish specific
									structures such as Pyramids of Intervention, Response to Intervention
									(RTI) frameworks and/or explicit policies and procedures.</p>
								<p>A school’s Academic Pyramid of Interventions is a unique, living
									document, focused on meeting the needs of the students it serves.</p>
								<p>There is a recognised process for referral to provide students with
									access to services (district, Child and Youth, etc.). District has a
									systemic response to ensure access to support services and other
									resources.</p>
								<p>Teams frequently refer to the pyramid during the identification of
									interventions to support learners (e.g., team meetings, ESS meetings,
									PLCs). Interventions proven to be ineffective over time, based on
									data/evidence, are removed. Teams continually learn about and apply
									new interventions, and monitor their effectiveness. High-impact,
									school-based interventions are added to the pyramid. Schools use
									metrics (data driven decision making, White, 2011) to monitor the
									number of students receiving Tier 2 and 3 interventions on a regular
									basis. Staff should monitor the movement of students in and between
									tiers on a regular basis.</p>
								<p>Pyramid users recognize that students may receive a combination of
									intervention supports (i.e., tier 1 and 2) at any given point in time.
									Students should not be labelled tier “X” students or remain in a tier
									without on-going assessment. Through frequent intervention and
									assessment, the primary goal is to support the student through core

								<u><b>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>The teachers and ESTs have a collaborative process for identifying
									students who may require or benefit from accommodations. For example,
									teachers use an accommodation checklist to track and monitor the use
									of universal accommodations. Frequent intervention and assessment
									provide data needed to inform decision-making. Prior to creating a
									PLP-A, there is a referral process and a collaborative dialogue with
									the ESS Team.</p>

								<b><u>DEFINITION:</u></b>
								<p>A Personalized Learning Plan (PLP): a plan for a student who
									requires specific and individual identification of practical
									strategies, goals, outcomes, targets and educational supports that
									ensure the student experiences success in learning that is meaningful
									and appropriate, considering the student’s individual needs.</p>
								<p>Accommodation – an accommodation is intended to help the student to
									fully access and participate in the prescribed curriculum without
									changing the instructional content (Skinner, Pappas, & Davis, 2005).
									An accommodation is intended to remove barriers to learning while
									still expecting that students will master the same instructional
									content as their typical peers.</p>

								<div style="padding: 1em 2em">
									<p><b>Universal accommodations</b> – are strategies, technologies or
										adjustments that enable a student to reach prescribed outcomes and
										can be used as needed. Universal accommodations do not necessitate a
										PLP or prior approval for provincial assessments.</p>
									<p>School personnel know that <b>universal accommodations</b> are
										intended to help students to fully access and participate in the <b>prescribed</b>
										curriculum without changing the instructional content. Students
										master the same content as their peers. This includes accommodated:</p>
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>presentation/delivery of curricular outcomes</li>
										<li>product /means by which students demonstrate learning</li>
										<li>process/environment</li>
									</ul>

									<br>

									<p><b>Justified accommodations</b> – are documented strategies,
										technologies or adjustments without which the student <b>would not</b>
										be able to access the curriculum and/or demonstrate their knowledge.
										These accommodations are documented within a PLP and require prior
										approval to be accessed during provincial assessments.</p>
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>A <b>scribe</b> would be a justified accommodation if the child
											would not be able to succeed without the accommodation</li>
										<li><b>Extended time</b> would be a justified accommodation if it
											were more than double the time</li>
									</ul>

									<br>

									<p><b>Adjusted Curriculum (Modified)</b> – for students who require
										adjustments to the curriculum to be successful. The general intent of
										the curriculum is maintained but the depth of treatment of the
										outcomes is altered or deleted.</p>

									<br>

									<p><b>Individualization</b> – plans for students who need personalized
										planning that is outside of the prescribed curriculum. </p>

								<b><u>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p><b>A school’s Behavioral Pyramid of Interventions is a unique,
										living document, focused on meeting the needs of the students it
										serves.</b></p>
								<p>Teams frequently refer to the pyramid during the identification of
									interventions to support learners (e.g., team meetings, ESS meetings,
									PLCs). Interventions proven to be ineffective over time, based on
									data, are removed. Teams continually learn about and apply new
									interventions, and monitor their effectiveness. High-impact,
									school-based interventions are added to the pyramid. Schools use
									metrics to monitor the number of students receiving tier 2 and 3
									interventions on a regular basis. Staff should monitor the movement of
									students in and between Tiers on a regular basis.</p>
								<p>Pyramid users recognize that students may receive a combination of
									intervention supports (i.e., tier 1 and 2) at any given point in time.
									Students should not be labelled tier “X” students or remain in a tier
									without on-going assessment. Through frequent intervention and
									assessment, the primary goal is to support the student through core
									instruction (tier 1 interventions).</p>
								<p>Behaviour tracking is accessible to all appropriate staff. There is
									a process for office referral and teacher follow-up. Attendance is
									monitored and underlying causal factors examined for absenteeism.
									School personnel have a process for follow-up, including the
									identification of interventions and support.</p>

									practice, if the school and/or families consider it appropriate in an
									individual case, the superintendent must:</p>
								<ul class="indented-list">
									<li>Ensure teachers that are familiar with the student’s progress and

								<b><u>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>Educators should focus on groups who may be marginalized within and
									beyond the learning environment. These groups include, but are not
									limited to, First Nations populations, culturally and linguistically
									diverse students, newcomers, English Language Learners (ELLs),
									LGBTQ2S+ students and their supporters (Tranter, Carson and Boland,
									2018, p. 128).</p>
								<p>“Anti-Oppressive education makes explicit the idea that education,
									like all social institutions, can perpetuate the oppression of some
									students based on their background and social status, and seeks to
									remove oppressive practices wherever possible” (Tranter, Carson and
									Boland, 2018, p. 128).</p>
								<p>“Anti- oppressive practice in an educational context seeks to
									identify oppressive practices in classrooms, schools, and educational
									policies in order to make education more socially just, as well as to
									make society more just” (Tranter, Carson and Boland, 2018, p. 128).</p>

								<br>

								<p>General strategies are as follows:</p>
								<ul class="indented-list">
									<li>Ensuring that teaching materials represent all groups equally</li>
									<li>Directly challenging the misrepresentation of groups or the
										one-sided nature of information, if/when found in teaching materials</li>
									<li>Rethinking class activities and assignments to relocate
										marginalized students to a higher status</li>
									<li>Encouraging assignments that challenge mainstream thinking and
										traditional narratives about social and cultural ideals</li>
									<li>Ensuring that all students are fully integrated and are full
										participants in the classroom (Tranter, Carson and Boland, 2018, p.
										128)</li>
								</ul>

								<br>

								<p>Educators and students show that they genuinely value diversity, in
									all its forms:</p>
								<ul class="indented-list">
									<li>They are culturally aware, sensitive and inclusive </li>
									<li>They are aware that we all hold internal, and often unconscious,
										biases (self-awareness) that may need to be examined</li>
									<li>They know the students</li>
									<li>They work to bridge differences among students</li>
									<li>They intentionally include all students</li>
									<li>They connect with families and the community (Tranter, Carson and
										Boland, 2018, pp. 129-131)</li>
								</ul>

								<b><u>DEFINITION:</u></b>
								<p><b><i>Common learning environment:</i></b> an inclusive environment
									where instruction is designed to be delivered to students of mixed
									ability and of the same age in their neighborhood school, while being
									responsive to their individual needs as a learner, and used for the
									majority of the students’ regular instruction hours. <i>Policy 322 –
										Inclusive Education</i></p>

								<b><u>EXPLANATION:</u></b>
								<p>Physical inclusion includes:</p>
								<ul class="indented-list">
									<li>Alternate placement is planned for as a temporary situation and
										monitored on an ongoing basis, as indicated in Policy 322. Maximum
										integration (in the best interests of the child) in the regular
										learning environment is preferred</li>
									<li>Use of assistive technology to maximize student integration into
										the common learning environment </li>
									<li>Physical accessibility to all areas used by students, including
										ensuring wheelchair access for students and/or adults </li>
									<li>Planning in advance to accommodate upcoming needs </li>
									<li>Maximum integration and engagement of students in the common
										learning/classroom environment; students should not be consistently
										in the back or periphery of classes unless there is a justifiable
										reason or a student preference </li>
									<li>All decisions and placements should be in the best interests of
										the student(s)</li>
									<li>When a student is removed from the common learning environment for
										intervention, either academic or behavioral, there is an established
										plan for reintegration. See policy 322</li>

									These devices/supports allow students to actively engage in improving
									or maintaining their ability to meet learning outcomes and maximize
									their learning success. In most cases, the assistive technology
									required will be needed by these students throughout their school
									careers and should travel with them from class to class, grade to
									grade and school to school.</p>

								<b><u>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>“Those who may be marginalized” refers to individuals and groups
									whose characteristics are associated with systemic or chronic risk
									factors (e.g., low SES, non-attendance, high family mobility, sexual
									minority and gender independent (LGBTQ2S+) youth, students/family
									members with mental health concerns). When applied to students the
									term “marginalized populations” (formerly identified as at-risk
									populations), includes those who have a strong potential for school
									drop out, self-harm, or failure to thrive.</p>
								<p>The school has processes in place for identifying these students and
									families, intentionally building connections and supports, and
									ensuring advocacy. This includes gathering data about the composition
									of the student body and school community to plan for internal and
									external supports. It also includes assigning staff and students to
									make daily, informal contact with those who are vulnerable.</p>
								<p>Identified students require added supports to be able to access
									education on an equal basis with others. In complex cases school
									personnel collaborate with district, Department of Social Development,
									and Child and Youth.</p>

								<b><u>EXPLANATION:</u></b>
								<p>In effective schools, personnel intentionally take note of the
									composition of the community served by the school and the
									characteristics of the families, honouring diverse family compositions
									and a variety of family traditions. Once resources and needs among
									families are identified, processes are established to engage families,
									taking diverse values, composition, and needs into account. This
									includes families who may have economic, social and/or cultural
									challenges, or characteristics that impact their experiences in the
									school community. For example, in many New Brunswick schools EAL
									(English as an Additional Language) programs have been organized for
									families who have emigrated from various regions of the world
									(newcomers). Some schools have made progress in recognizing and
									welcoming families with members who have non-traditional gender
									identities and/or sexual orientation. This also includes honouring the
									desired involvement and contributions of extended, blended and
									separated families that wish to support their children.</p>

								<b><u>EXAMPLES</u></b>
								<ul class="indented-list">
									<li>Information sent home is brief, clear and easy to understand</li>
									<li>Copies of student report cards and other important information is
										provided to both families when they are separated (custody order
										permitting)</li>
									<li>Information is made accessible in many ways, including up-to-date
										web pages</li>
									<li>School personnel who answer the phone and receive families
										arriving at the school have a service orientation and understand the
										impact they make on relationships with the school</li>
									<li>Volunteers are recruited who can help to translate, provide
										testimony of service and support new families whose children have
										diverse needs</li>

								<b><u>EXPLANATION:</u></b>
								<p>The Core Leadership Team (CLT) is composed of the Principal,
									Vice-Principal and a selection of key teacher leaders. This should
									include Education Support Teacher-Guidance (EST-G) and Education
									Support Teacher - Resource (EST-R) representation. Like all learning
									teams in the school, this team should be organized in a very
									structured manner. Team time should be regularly scheduled; norms
									should be established; agendas should be created; minutes should be
									kept and goals and follow-up actions should be developed and
									monitored. Since the key objective of the CLT is to help facilitate
									continuous improvement, change and growth, reporting to the entire
									staff, soliciting feedback, monitoring school-based teams and
									monitoring the Improvement Plan on a routine basis are critical
									responsibilities of this team.</p>

								<b><u>DEFINITION:</u></b>
								<p>Distributed or distributive leadership, involves a greater degree of
									distributing power, information and decision-making authority to
									individuals within the system. This includes “the free-flowing form of
									ongoing engagement by stakeholders… it…honors the input and
									capabilities of all who have a stake in the affairs of the school”
									(Daresh, 2007, p. 123). Current literature includes a number of terms
									for this concept (e.g., Guiding Coalition, Core Leadership Team and
									School Management Team). Which model a school chooses to implement
									will depend upon its size, configuration and school goals.</p>

								<b><u>EXPLANATION:</u></b>
								<p><b><i>Shared decision-making</i></b> refers to making decisions
									collaboratively, calling upon the assistance of, and feedback from,
									staff and team members, either collectively or in part depending on
									the nature of the situation. The key to successful shared
									decision-making practices is to ensure all staff members clearly
									understand their roles and responsibilities as well as understanding
									and respecting that not all decisions can be made in a “shared”
									manner. In some instances, the school leader must make decisions
									independently based on evidence.
									<br>
									One characteristic of shared decision-making is evidence of effective
									two-way communication between school administrators and staff members.

									School leaders (e.g., administrators, SPRs, department heads, ESTs,

										<li>Does this teaming structure have a clear purpose? Is the purpose

										<li>Are previously identified action items reviewed? Were they acted

										<li>Are minutes taken during meetings? Are ‘actions items’ clearly
											identified?
										<li>Is data being used to monitor student progress toward the SMART
											targets? Is the SIP monitored regularly?
										<li>Are the individuals responsible for leading and monitoring
											initiatives clearly identified?
										<li>Is there a balance of voices and shared decision-making?
										<li>Are academic/behavioural interventions being collaboratively
											identified and implemented? Is frequent assessment being used to
											monitor interventions?

									<i>School leaders participate in team monitoring of SIP goals. During

									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>Review the identified goals
										<li>Review relevant data
										<li>Identify which students are progressing and/or have met the goals
										<li>Plan interventions for students who are not developing the

											academic or behavioural interventions)
									</ul>

									<i>When school leaders are unable to participate in team meetings,
										they could:</i>
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>Initiate a follow-up conversation with a team member, by asking,
											“Are students learning what we need them to learn?” or “Are we going
											to reach or exceed our March behavior target for student X?”
										<li>View the contents of the team’s PLC binder, which should include:
											targeted goals, relevant data, the individuals responsible for
											leading and monitoring initiatives, planning for core instruction

									<b><u>EXAMPLE:</u></b>
									<br>
									By looking at data from Our School the school determined that student
									engagement was lower than expected. The staff co-constructed criteria
									for what student engagement would look like in all classes and
									developed a short look-for. Over the next three weeks SPR’s, Vice
									Principals and Resource teachers will complete walkthroughs throughout
									the school to gather data on established criteria. Staff will then

									cycles which meet or exceed the minimal requirements set by Districts
									and/or EECD.
									<br><br>
									Each district has prescribed standards for formal teacher evaluation.
									<br><br>
									All teachers should receive regular informal feedback in the way of
									walkthroughs, observations, and professional growth goal conferencing

									Collective efficacy is defined as “a group's shared belief in its
									conjoint capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action
									required to produce given levels of attainments” (Bandura, 1997, p.
									477). Effective teams operate as a professional learning community.
									This community is a collaboration of educators who work together to
									establish essential learning outcomes, seek out research-based best
									practices, test them out in the classroom, and then continuously
									improve the process based on results (Dufour, Dufour, Eaker, Many, and
									Mattos, 2016).
									<br><br>
									<i>Please note: Some team responsibilities are legislated and
										delineated in policy. For example, the school-based ESS Team must
										meet on a regular basis, preferably once a week, but at least every
										10 school days.</i> (Policy 322 for school-based ESS Teams; s.6.10.3)

								<u><b>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>
									<b>School-based common assessments</b> are designed by teachers to
									provide formative feedback to improve teaching and learning. These are
									developed to ensure consistency of standards among teachers. Common
									assessments are used at various points in the year (end of unit,
									term/semester, and end of year) and are not necessarily lengthy.
									Common assessments are given by two or more instructors with the
									intention of collaboratively examining the results for:
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>Shared learning
										<li>Instructional planning for individual students
										<li>As a team, identify which targets from the assessment require
											more attention?
										<li>As a team, identify which students did not master which targets?
										<li>As a team, identify which classrooms require additional support?
										<li>As an individual teacher, determine which area was my lowest, and
											how can I improve in that area?
									</ul>

									<u><b>EXAMPLES:</b></u>
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>Grade 3 teachers create and administer common assessments every
											two weeks to monitor student learning and provide next steps for
											instruction
										<li>High School teachers may create a common end of unit assessment
											to verify student learning
									</ul>
									<br>
									Benchmark assessments are given periodically throughout the school
									year at specified times. The assessments evaluate students’ knowledge
									and skills relative to an explicit set of longer-term goals, usually
									curriculum outcomes. The design and choice of benchmark assessment is
									driven by purpose and intended users, and informs decision-making at
									the student, classroom, school and/or district level. There should be
									a balance between school and district developed benchmarks.

								<u><b>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>
									Student achievement data refers to school-based assessments, district
									assessments and large-scale provincial, national and international
									assessments. Schools should gather and monitor assessment data
									frequently to provide support for teaching and learning.
									<br><br>
									<u><b>EXAMPLES:</b></u>
									<br>
									Some examples of routine gathering and monitoring data include:
									District and school-based benchmarking (running records, common
									assessments, AIMSweb)
									Monitoring (Data Walls, dashboards, PLC Team Meetings meeting minutes,
									ESS Team Meeting, SIP Monitoring Template)
									<br><br>
									Provincial data should be closely monitored by staff to determine
									longitudinal trends associated with cohorts of students. Staff should
									use this data to compare to district and provincial trends.
									<br><br>
									Teachers should be aware of weighting and other test characteristics
									of provincial assessments which are described in testing specification
									documents. These are typically found in the appendix of the
									assessment. Awareness of this information will help schools to plan
									and support effective school-wide interventions.

									<u><b>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
									Profiles can take many forms and include class and individual learner
									profiles.
									<br><br>
									<u><b>DEFINITION:</b></u>
									Class Profiles establish a collective record which provides
									information about academic and/or social/emotional outcomes (e.g.,
									participation in co – and extra-curricular activities) and is used to
									plan for appropriate instruction/interventions, such as responsive
									flexible groupings.
									<br><br>
									<b><i>Individual Learner Profiles</i></b> include checklists or
									records of academic outcomes, accommodations and
									interests/considerations for each student.
									<br><br>
									<u><b>EXAMPLES:</b></u> – Individual Learner Profile:
									A general learning checklist could include indicators about:
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>Academic checklists
										<li>“Write Traits”
										<li>Instructional reading levels
										<li>Interests
										<li>Special skills
										<li>Preferred intelligences
										<li>Learning styles
										<li>Work ethic
										<li>Attendance
										<li>Social considerations
										<li>Behavior
										<li>Seating considerations
									</ul>

									An example of an academic checklist could be one that outlines the
									outcomes expected for a subject area:
									<br><br>

									<br>
									<b>Learning Styles</b> can be defined as the usual or characteristic
									way in which a learner goes about the task of learning. People
									perceive and learn in different ways. It is believed that most people
									favour some particular method of interacting with, taking in and
									processing stimuli and information. It has been proposed that teachers
									should assess the learning styles of their students and provide
									opportunities for students to learn in a variety of ways.

								<u><b>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>
									Effective schools build partnerships with families. These partnerships
									assist the school to accomplish strategic goals. They also foster
									community connections, family support for the work of teachers,
									effective problem-solving regarding behavioural issues and other areas
									affecting the student body.
									<br><br>
									<u><b>EXAMPLES:</b></u>
									<br>
									These partnerships can be classified as:
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li><b>Family Involvement</b>: hot lunch, library, and Home and
											School volunteers
										<li><b>Famiy Curricular Engagement</b>: Encouraging families to
											support learning by asking students higher order questions during
											and after reading at home

								<p>
									School leaders, teachers, support staff, students and families collaborate to establish and maintain an atmosphere of high expectations for all learners. Respecting Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), instruction is personalized with scaffolding being used to ensure that lessons challenge students at their level while ensuring that student potential for academic, behavioral, and social-emotional growth is maximized.
								</p>
								<p>
									In order to ensure high expectations, the fundamentals of personalization should be applied. Bryk identifies “The Six Core Principles of Improvement” which may facilitate improved personalized learning:
									<ol class="indented-list">
										<li>Make the work problem-specific and user-centered.
										<li>Variation in performance is the core problem to address.
										<li>See the system that produces the current outcomes.
										<li>We cannot improve at scale what we cannot measure.
										<li>Anchor practice improvement in disciplined inquiry (Engage in rapid cycles of Plan, Do, Study, Act).
										<li>Accelerate improvements through networked communities.

								<u><b>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>
									In this indicator, <b><i>innovation</i></b> refers to experimenting with new pedagogical practices or processes in response to professional learning and/or information gathering/data analysis. Controlled risk-taking in conjunction with <b><i>action research</i></b> (Lewin & Weiss Lewin, 1946) can help educators to discover/adjust practices in an efficient, strategic manner.
									<br>
									In order to improve student learning, teachers are part of a culture of continuous improvement and are willing to experiment with new methods, strategies, and a variety of approaches in their teaching.  They also encourage, plan for, and foster, risk-taking learning opportunities and activities for their students.

								<u><b>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>
									Relationships can include student-student, teacher-student, school-familial relations and relationships with stakeholders and partners.  Restorative practices are based on the principals of restorative justice.  They work to build a sense of belonging, safety and social responsibility within the learning environment and include targeted strategies for use by the school community for resolving conflict. This approach can include more intensive interventions for individuals who may have been involved in serious behavioural incidents.

								<u><b>SYSTEMATIC EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>
									Common behavioural expectations are built through the co-constructing of the Code of Conduct with school leaders, teachers, educational support staff, students, and families.  Staff members develop behavioral protocols such as: communication of rules to students, response to inappropriate behaviour, and reporting of inappropriate behaviour.
								</p>
								<p>
									Once behavioural expectations are established and communicated, all personnel are responsible for responding to inappropriate behaviour in a uniform manner (i.e., not ignoring it).  All personnel must respond consistently (i.e., rules and equitable responses are applied throughout the learning environment).
								</p>
								<u><b>EXAMPLES:</b></u>
								<p>
									Rule: cell phones must be off in every class until the teacher requests/permits their use for educational purposes.
									<br>
									Consequence for infraction: cell phone is left with the teacher until the end of the class.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Supporting Behavioural Growth</b>
									<br>
										The application does not, however, mean inflexible, one-size-fits-all consequences. Although consistency and uniformity are important, students must also understand the primary intent of consequences is to eliminate undesirable behaviour and foster positive behaviour. It is learning, not punishment.  Therefore, the consequence must be student-centered and situation-appropriate.  Staff must consistently respond to behaviour of students who have IBSPs according to the strategies outlined in the plan. Restorative practises are prioritized in the plan.  See the explanatory note for indicator 20.2 for further detail on restorative practices.
								</p>
								<u><b>DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOUR EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>
									Disruptive behaviours are clearly defined.  Schools develop intentional processes which support effective response to threats or safety issues/concerns (e.g., school-based behavior protocols).  School personnel have received the appropriate training needed to follow the components of the established protocols.  Communication with families and/or service providers is timely.  Proactive planning may involve:  reviewing or renewing plans, post intervention strategies, restorative circles, etc.
								</p>
								<p>
									Bullying is defined clearly; students, staff and families can distinguish between bullying and other unwanted behaviours – most students can explain the difference between bullying and conflict.  Bullying/abuse of students based on particular characteristics is recognized and addressed specifically (e.g., exceptionalities, sexual minority, gender independent, cultural, linguistic and religious minorities, students at risk for behavioural issues, and/or students lacking pro-social skills)
								</p>

								<u><b>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>
									With this approach, staff members work intentionally to foster learner engagement by personalizing learning. Personalization involves developing learner agency by promoting autonomy, competence, relatedness, and relevance.
								</p>
								<p>
									Rooted in Deci and Ryan’s work on self-determination and motivation, Morrison and Peterson’s work on mental fitness, and Marzano, Pickering, and Heflebower’s work on engagement, the learning through personalization (engagement) mindset means fostering learner:
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>Autonomy – Learner voice and choice about what, when, how, and where they learn and work
										<li>Competence – Learners have the necessary skills and knowledge to complete work successfully (readiness), work within their zone of proximal development where rigorous learning happens with scaffolding, and work from strengths
										<li>Relatedness – Learners feel connected with others and a sense of belonging
										<li>Relevance – Learners see their work connected to their interests, passions, culture, background, current needs, and future
										<li>Effectively fostering these four components of personalization will cultivate engagement which will lead to deeper learning while also improving learner agency and resiliency

								<b><u>EXPLANATION:</u></b>
								<p>
									Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is the process of designing and delivering curricula, materials, and environments in a manner that makes them accessible and usable to all students.  When teachers use the principles associated with UDL, they remove barriers, which traditionally have marginalized specific student populations.
								</p>
								<p>
									UDL and differentiated instruction are different.  UDL is a framework that impacts teacher decision making early in the school year or during larger unit planning. Teachers apply UDL principles during the onset, whereas they use Differentiated Instruction practices during daily lesson planning.
								</p>
								<b><u>EXAMPLES:</u></b>
								<ul class="indented-list">
									<li>How teachers design and organize their classroom space
									<li>Varied selection of instructional resources during the unit planning stage
									<li>Storage of assessment tools to support student self-access (e.g., checklists, rubrics)
								</ul>
								<p>
									A teacher may make a variety of graphic organizers available for students to select and use before and during the writing process.  All students know where in the classroom they can access these scaffolds.  Not all students will need them, but for some, they are critical organizational tools.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>1. Ideas and information are represented in multiple ways?</b>
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>Your course syllabus clearly describes the content and your expectations of the students
										<li>You begin each class with an outline of what will be covered
										<li>You post electronic equivalents of paper handouts and required reading assignments in alternative formats such as audio and video

								</p>
								<p>
									<b>2. Students can express their comprehension in multiple ways?</b>
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>You encourage students to demonstrate knowledge and skills in ways other than traditional tests and exams (e.g., written essays, projects, portfolios, journals)
										<li>Your assessments measure students’ achievement of the learning objectives, as they are stated on the syllabus
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>3. Students have multiple opportunities for engagement?</b>

								<p>
									The reason for this collaboration is so that each person involved in fostering the learning and development of a student can contribute their knowledge and expertise to achieve the best results for the student. Students are included to the full extent possible, and using language that is understood by the student.
									<br>
									<b>See the definition for Personalized Learning Plans (PLP) in the explanatory note for indicator 4.2.</b>
								</p>

								<p>
									Arriving at the decision that a PLP is needed is not a clinical process (e.g., does not require a psycho-educational assessment), though it can include clinically-based information, depending on the student.  The choice to enact a PLP for a student will continue to be determined by the school ESS Team in consultation with the classroom teacher(s), families, other professionals as required and the student as appropriate.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Policy 322 – Inclusive Education</b>
									<br>
									<b>6.3 Personalized Learning Plan (PLP)</b>
									<br>
									6.3.1 Students must receive a Personalized Learning Plan when one or more of the following conditions exist:
									<br>
									1) Strategies beyond robust instruction are required.
									<br>
									2) Behavioural supports, as outlined in section 6.6 of Policy 703 – Positive Learning and Working Environment, are required.
									<br>
									3) The common learning environment is to be varied in accordance with section 6.4 of this policy.
									<br><br>
									6.3.2 A principal must ensure:
									<br>
									1)	A PLP is developed by a planning team consisting of the school administration, teacher(s), relevant members of the Education Support Services (ESS) Team, as well as families, the student, and educational assistants as appropriate, and support people from community organizations as required.
									<br><br>
									6.3.3 Classroom teachers must:
									<br>
									4)	Ensure lesson plans and instructional strategies reflect the requirements of the PLP.
								</p>

								<b><u>LOOK FOR:</u></b>
								<p>
									<b>Products:</b>
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>A section is included in the lesson plan with guiding questions or notes that assist the teacher to differentiate on an ongoing basis in relation to the PLPs of students in the class. This could also be accomplished by using a folder with lesson plans/components for students who have a PLP
										<li>Collaboration is indicated in the PLP by the presence of signatures, successive meeting dates, etc.
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Conversations:</b>
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>In in keeping with their age and abilities, students have input into their PLP and can speak to the content
										<li>Families indicate they have been involved in the planning of the PLP and understand the PLP goals
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Observations:</b>
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>PLPs/PLP goals are consulted daily by the subject teacher and EA(s) as applicable
										<li>Subject teachers and EST-R meet to discuss student progress and ways to adjust lesson plans to better address students needs
										<li>Educational Assistants are never the primary instructors of any student, nor are they primarily responsible for developing lesson plans for any student (Creating an Inclusive School Culture, NBACL, 2011, page 56).

								<p>
									Educators work intentionally to ensure that opportunities to link instruction to real-world examples and addressing real-world problems are maximized.  This includes linking learning opportunities to issues that are more meaningful to students (personalization through student choice), which helps promote student engagement.

								<b><u>EXPLANATION:</b></u>
								<p>
									Teachers achieve their personal best when they use effective instructional practices, which support higher-order thinking.
								</p>
								<b><u>EXAMPLES:</b></u>
								<p>
									Dean and Marzano’s (2012) top nine high-yield teaching strategies:
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>Identifying similarities and differences
										<li>Summarizing and note taking
										<li>Reinforcing effort and providing recognition
										<li>Homework and practice
										<li>Non-linguistic representations
										<li>Cooperative learning
										<li>Setting objectives and providing feedback
										<li>Generating and testing hypothesis
										<li>Questions, cues, and advance organizers
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									According to John Hattie (2009), high-impact, evidence-based teaching strategies include:
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>Direct instruction
										<li>Note taking and other study skills
										<li>Spaced practice
										<li>Feedback
										<li>Teaching metacognitive skills
										<li>Teaching problem solving skills
										<li>Reciprocal teaching
										<li>Mastery learning
										<li>Concept mapping
										<li>Worked examples
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>NB Curricula</b> support critical literacy skills.  Students must demonstrate proficiency in inferential and personal/critical comprehension tasks in response to viewed/read texts (e.g., newspaper articles, magazine advertisements, poetry).  Students require opportunities to participate in higher-order thinking skills (e.g., note-making) while reading, evaluating, and synthesizing text.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Bloom’s Taxonomy</b> provides an important framework for teachers to use to focus on higher-order thinking. By providing a hierarchy of levels, this taxonomy can assist teachers in designing performance tasks, crafting questions for conferring with students, and providing feedback on student work.
									<br>
									The taxonomy identifies six levels of Critical Thinking which can be used in the classroom to help develop all levels of thinking within the cognitive domain. The results will be improved attention to detail, increased comprehension and expanded problem-solving skills. The six levels are:
									<ul class="indented-list">
										<li>Knowledge
										<li>Comprehension
										<li>Application
										<li>Analysis
										<li>Synthesis
										<li>Evaluation

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p>
								<p><strong>This approach would include staff members working intentionally to foster an environment which includes Personalization of Learning.
								<br>
								</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalization involves promoting self-directed learning (student agency, autonomy, voice and choice) while working to achieve the New Brunswick Global Competencies. &nbsp;</span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilizing Deci and Ryan&rsquo;s approach, staff members adopt a mindset focused on engaging students and peers in the process of learning. &nbsp;This would include a focus on: </span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competence &ndash; using Vygotsky&rsquo;s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), the pedagogical environment focuses on scaffolding, mastery learning, readiness, and strength-based approaches </span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autonomy &ndash; promoting student voice, choice, and agency</span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatedness &ndash; includes identifying student interests, linking to prior knowledge, and using student choice to facilitate student engagement</span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relevance &ndash; includes promoting topics of interest to the students which also have relevance to the real world. Authentic learning, identifying real world application, and helping students identify social and cultural significance &nbsp;</span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effectively working toward these four components of personalized learning will help build student capacity, which in turn helps cultivate resilience and self-determination in learners. &nbsp;</span></p>
								<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to foster connectedness adults in the school intentionally take an interest in each student&rsquo;s academic work, behaviour and sense of belonging. &nbsp;</span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students feel that teachers and staff assist them when they need help. School personnel foster a caring atmosphere, which is used to promote connectedness. &nbsp;Building student resilience is one of the core school principles. This could include the use of </span><strong><em>advisory/advocacy programs: </em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrangements whereby adults and small groups of students have the opportunity to interact on a regularly scheduled basis in order to foster a caring environment which focuses on guidance and support as well as providing a forum for student voice. </span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fostering connectedness could also include the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relational Management Approach</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlined in &ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">From</span></em> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silo&rsquo;s to Systems&rdquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whereby: </span></p>
								<ul>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers know student&rsquo;s names and take time to chat with them outside of classrooms</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers know something about students in classes and check in with them about recent events in their lives</span></li>

								<p><strong>DEFINITION:</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Metacognition</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is the process of thinking about one&rsquo;s own thought processes. Pressley, M. (2003) defines metacognition as</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> knowledge of the thinking processes. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;It is &ldquo;knowing about knowing&rdquo; or &ldquo;thinking about thinking. &ldquo;It is that &lsquo;inner voice&rsquo; that helps one solves problems, strategize, and self-evaluate performance. &nbsp;Metacognition occurs in the here and now as students decide on how to solve problems or complete tasks. Students have developed metacognitive skills when they are able to answer the question, </span><strong>&ldquo;How has your thinking changed?&rdquo; </strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metacognitive skills enable the monitoring of one&rsquo;s own learning. Self-regulation of learning involves the learner being aware when they are and are not comprehending text or the task at hand and strategizing how to respond to this awareness.</span></p>
								<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
								<ul>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Reciprocal Teaching</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a strategy of metacognitive skill teaching, where the teacher models application of a reading strategy (predicting, questioning, summarizing, and clarifying) through their own think-aloud of why and how they apply the strategy. Students are then expected to begin to go through the process themselves. </span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Questions that are designed to guide student thinking when they are thinking about </span><strong>Parts of a Whole</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></li>
								<ol>
								<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the smaller parts that make up the whole?</span></li>
								<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would happen if each part was missing?</span></li>
								<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the function of each part?</span></li>
								<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do the parts work together to make the whole do what it does?</span></li>
								</ol>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prompting students to use </span><strong>Skillful Decision-Making</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serves to shift the center of gravity in the classroom away from a teacher-centered model to an active student-centered model. One could (1) break the students into &ldquo;collaborative thinking groups&rdquo; each with specific thinking tasks that contribute to the overall process, (2) provide them with various graphics that serve as reflection and recording devices for their thinking, and (3) provide oral guidance for them as they work through the thinking map for skillful decision making. This example takes students to a different thinking level than &ldquo;what choice is best&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; questions. &nbsp;Questions to support Skillful Decision-Making include: </span></li>
								<ol>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes a decision necessary?</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are my options?</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the likely consequences of these options?</span></li>

								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Articulating Strategy Selection and Use</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in any curricular area is an example of a metacognitive process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is important to get students to stand back from content-related thinking to engage in various types of metacognition. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One could start with the students identifying the kind of thinking they just engaged in, then describing how they did it, and then asking, &ldquo;Was this a good way to do this kind of thinking?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Does the procedure need modification. If so, how, and then, how can this be turned into an explicit plan for doing the same sort of thinking again?&rdquo;</span></li>

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers use a variety of classroom structures to support student learning&nbsp;(e.g., Writer&rsquo;s Workshop Model, Book Studies, Project-Based Learning).&nbsp; As Wilhelm (2007) explains both Problem- and Project-based Learning structures can be used as the method of learning during a large one-month unit (e.g., What makes a good relationship?) or as part of a teacher&rsquo;s pedagogy during a lesson.&nbsp;</span></p>
								<p><strong>Problem-based Learning (PBL)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject in the context of complex, multifaceted and realistic problems. Working in groups, students identify what they already know, what they need to know, and how and where to access new information that may lead to resolution of the problem. The role of the instructor is that of facilitator of learning who provides appropriate scaffolding of that process by:&nbsp; asking probing questions, providing appropriate resources, and leading class discussions, as well as designing student assessments.</span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six core characteristics of Problem-based learning:</span></p>
								<ul>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consists of student-centered learning</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning occurs in small groups </span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers act as facilitators or guides </span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A problem forms the basis for organized focus and stimulus for learning</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;">Problems stimulate the development and use of problem solving skills</li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;">New knowledge is obtained through means of self-directed learning</li>
								</ul>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Seven C&rsquo;s of Project Based Learning: </span></p>
								<ul>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Curriculum</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the starting point for PBL development is always learning outcomes from official provincial curriculum. </span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Competencies</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: along with meeting knowledge content outcomes, competencies are also instructed and assessed. </span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Collaboration</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: &nbsp;the final product, presentation, and/or exhibition is deliberately designed to be a task, or group of tasks, that cannot be completed by one individual but requires meaningful participation from all members of a high-performing team. Thus, a genuine need for collaboration is presented to students. </span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Current</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: &nbsp;the driving question frames the learning by presenting a current, real-world problem to be solved - one that is taken seriously by adults engaged in similar work.</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Community</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: where possible, to provide utmost relevance for students, expert assistance for teachers, and authentic assessment opportunity, the issue or problem should be based in the local community. </span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Connected Students</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: &nbsp;should be able to connect to the question to be answered; they should see the value in their work beyond just getting a final mark. </span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cool!</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A great PBL engages students right from the beginning with a launch activity (the &ldquo;grabber&rdquo;) designed to capture their interest followed by the introduction of a PBL &ldquo;briefcase&rdquo; which includes rubrics for assessment, a list of resources, project milestones, final presentation schedules, etc. so that there is clarity of expectations, and thus a sense of &ldquo;do-ability&rdquo; and accomplishment for the student. </span></li>

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students should work collaboratively towards one common goal, in both formalized teacher-created intentional groupings and with self-selected peers. &nbsp;&nbsp;The learning in the group is </span><strong>interdependent, with each member of the group contributing and comprehending</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (e.g., book studies, reciprocal teaching, Project-based Learning). After students receive high-impact instruction, they spend time practicing the skills, both independently and collaboratively.</span><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-class observations should note a ratio of 20% teacher voice and 80% student voice. &nbsp;Students are also provided with frequent, less formal, opportunities to collaborate (e.g., peer conferencing, turn-and-talk).</span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential information for students to collaborate and cooperate effectively includes:</span></p>
								<ul>

								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discussing norms/rules</span></li>

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In high performing schools, teachers use available technology </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">in meaningful ways</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to engage students in their learning. &nbsp;This indicator </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">is not</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> referring to the amount of technology that is available (i.e., all classrooms being equipped with SMARTBoards or the school having several computer labs in operation) </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">nor is it</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> referring to the frequency of integrating technology in instruction. &nbsp;Rather, the emphasis here is on how technology is being effectively used by teachers to promote student learning.</span></p>
								<p><strong>Questions to consider:</strong></p>
								<ul>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the teacher using the SMARTBoard as a traditional blackboard or projector or as a means of providing students with relevant, interactive learning experiences? </span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are computers being used as a means for student self-directed learning opportunities (e.g., Web-Quests, Blogs)? </span></li>

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION: </strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Literacy remains one of the most important aspects of education and is a strong predictor of student success as adults. &nbsp;As Moore (1999) states, &ldquo;Adolescents entering the adult world in the 21st century will read and write more than at any other time in human history. They will need advanced levels of literacy to perform their jobs, run their households, act as citizens, and conduct their personal lives. They will need literacy to cope with the flood of information they will find everywhere they turn&rdquo; (p.3). &nbsp;</span></p>

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality curricula and instruction, and authentic experiences are used to promote the acquisition and appreciation of additional languages.</span></p>
								<p><strong><em>Multiculturalism</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be defined, in the Canadian context, as the recognition, accommodation and celebration of difference, with the goal of unity and belonging for all. Plurilingualism is the celebration of the ability of a person who has competence in more than one language, to be able to draw on whichever language fits the situation best. &nbsp;It is different than multilingualism, which could be explained as having multiple languages, that sit side-by-side (not intertwined) and are used for separate purposes. </span><strong><em>Plurilingualism</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on the other hand, recognizes that an individual may switch from language to language according to the situation. &nbsp;In fact, plurilinguals use one language or another interchangeably, according to the situation, because the languages we learn are all mixed together in our development, not in neat boxes separate from the others. A plurilingual is afforded a way of understanding the world and its many cultures through languages; the gap between people and cultures is minimized. </span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plurilingualism is tied to pluricultural competence, which is tied, in some ways, to the Canadian understanding of multiculturalism. Pluricultural competence is the recognition (personally and individually) that exchange and meditation between cultures and through languages is what brings about true multiculturalism. </span></p>

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Communication&rdquo; in French and additional language classes refers to the instruction, dialogue and conversation that occurs during class time. The use of French should be observed on the part of teachers and students.</span></p>
								<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During French and additional language classes, students should converse in the language during formal and informal sharing opportunities and during general dialogue with others (e.g., when asking to borrow an eraser from a peer). </span></p>
								<p><strong>EXCEPTION: </strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In English as an Additional Language (EAL), students, at times, will need to converse in a shared home language (if available) to ensure they understand the content and next steps. Additionally, research shows that it is important when working with newcomer populations who are asked to function in English all day, to show a valuing of the home language and culture when possible. Therefore, at times, students in EAL class may be asked to share with the class &ldquo;how to say this word&rdquo; in their home language, or what &ldquo;x concept&rdquo; means in their culture. This valuing of plurilingualism adds to students&rsquo; sense of safety and belonging in the classroom, which will in turn boost their achievement in the learning of the additional language. </span></p>

								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
								<p><strong>To support numeracy development, teachers across the curriculum can:</strong></p>
								<ul>
								<ul>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore and encourage discussions regarding patterns which can be found in all subject areas (e.g., music rhythm, data from science investigations, poetry, art design, statistics in social studies, etc.)</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage students to solve problems with calculations in a variety of ways depending on the numbers involved (e.g., mental math, paper/pencil, calculators)</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the same conventions for reading and writing numbers as done in mathematics classes (e.g., 6145.38 does not include a comma to separate the thousands and hundreds places and it is read as six thousand, one hundred, forty-five </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thirty-eight hundredths</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use measurement skills and units that are grade appropriate according to the mathematics curriculum (e.g., centimetre, metre, kilometre, gram, kilogram, millilitre, litre)</span></li>
								</ul>
								</ul>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<ul>
								<li><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use and discuss a variety of data displays and have students create their own based on what is grade-appropriate. Students need to be able to read and interpret a variety of charts, graphs, and other displays</span></strong></li>
								</ul>
								<ul>
								<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage students to&nbsp;estimate prior to calculations to predict solutions and after to determine if their solution is reasonable</span></li>
								</ul>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<ul>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrate that they believe all students can learn math and the teacher models a positive attitude toward learning</span></li>
								</ul>
								<p><br /><strong>Many connections to math in other subject areas can be made, including the following:</strong></p>
								<ul>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numbers: reading and writing numbers appropriately (34 650 is written without a comma and is read as thirty-four thousand six hundred fifty; 7.09 is read as seven and nine thousandths)</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculations: encourage the use of mental math and estimation</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patterns (stories, poetry, results of investigations, art designs, music, etc.)</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measurement (units of measurement, distances, mass, area, volume, time, rate, speed, etc.)</span></li>

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessments are purpose-driven. &nbsp;Teachers understand the purpose of the assessment. &nbsp;In order to decide the appropriate type of assessment, they first determine whether they are: planning learning, supporting learning, monitoring learning or verifying learning. &nbsp;They subsequently choose the appropriate assessment for the purpose and determine next steps in instruction.</span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools should have a well-defined process to collect and examine evidence, including formative and summative assessments, which inform progress toward identified school goals, identify needs, planning and goal development, to assist schools to effectively allocate resources and plan based on PL needs. </span></p>
								<p><strong>DEFINITION:</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Formative assessment</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> practices include</span><strong> frequent</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, interactive assessments of student progress and comprehension. &nbsp;Often defined as assessment for learning, formative assessment is an ongoing, dynamic process. Formative assessment takes place during the learning process when both the teacher and the student can make decisions towards promoting further learning.</span></p>
								<p><strong>Summative assessment</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is used </span><strong>periodically</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a means to determine a student&rsquo;s mastery and understanding of information, skills, concepts, or processes and serves as a summary of performance. &nbsp;Often defined as assessment of learning, summative assessment is used to make a judgment, such as what grade a student will receive, or to determine whether a particular program was effective. &nbsp;</span></p>

								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where am I now? </span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where am I going? </span></li>

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educators use ongoing formative assessment to adjust instructional strategies to support diverse learners. &nbsp;This would include ongoing analysis using: formal and informal observations, conversations with students (e.g., conferencing as well as informal dialogue), and the assessment of products to ensure that lessons are diversified (content, process and product) to address the diverse needs of students. Adjustments should be observable in daily/weekly planning. </span></p>

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to </span><strong>effective learning feedback</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that it is both timely and meaningful. In order to ensure students have the opportunity to establish effective learning goals and priorities, they need to receive feedback that is targeted on specific strengths and challenges. &nbsp;This feedback needs to be shared in a timely manner. For example, brief (three-minute) teacher/student writing conferences could hone-in on one thing that is working for the student and one thing that needs attention. Feedback can be written or oral. &nbsp;The student should be able to identify her or his next steps, based on the feedback provided. </span></p>
								<p><strong>DEFINITION:</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Goal-Referenced Feedback </strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students need reminders about goals and the criteria by which they should self-assess. &nbsp;For example, a teacher might say, &ldquo;The point of this writing task is to make the reader laugh. &nbsp;So, when rereading your draft, or getting feedback from peers, ask, &ldquo;How funny is this? Where might it be funnier?&rdquo; (Wiggins, 2012).</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dedicated time for student reflection should be observable in lesson planning and practice.&nbsp; Students should have ongoing formal and informal opportunities to share what they have learned and how their thinking has changed.</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers should be able to describe the student&rsquo;s outcomes in general terms and use the student&rsquo;s goals and outcomes for daily planning.

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p>
								<p><strong><em>Ongoing Review</em></strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this indicator, &ldquo;ongoing review&rdquo; means the frequency of review is appropriate for the learning outcomes. &nbsp;More frequent review may be needed when working on outcomes for which the student&rsquo;s speed of progress is difficult to predict. &nbsp;This may also be the case when there are unforeseen changes to the learning environment or the learner&rsquo;s situation (e.g., Outcome: student is working on applying co-developed strategies for self-regulating aggressive verbal responses &ndash; Situation: student&rsquo;s home situation changes when she is placed in a foster home).</span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The frequency of availability of the data/evidence required to assess progress also impacts the ability to review goals and outcomes. Reviewing the PLP requires the teacher&rsquo;s time. When planning the goal/outcome, and its corresponding evidence of learning, choose the most meaningful evidence and reflect on the least labour-intensive manner in which it can be obtained. </span></p>

								<p><strong>Policy 322 and Allocation of Time:</strong></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resource Education Support Teachers must direct a minimum of 60% of available time (FTE) over the course of the school year, directly supporting and collaborating with classroom teachers. &nbsp;(Policy 322) Supports include:</span></p>
								<ul>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classroom observation and feedback (teacher self-identified support) *</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-planning of instruction </span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-teaching* </span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initiation and supporting instructional strategies</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem solving</span></li>
								<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modeling*</span></li>
								</ul>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Essential to each of these types of supports, are intentional pre- and post-support conversations. &nbsp;For example, before an EST models a specific pedagogical approach, the EST and teacher should decide upon the lesson &ldquo;look fors.&rdquo; &nbsp;After modeling, the EST and teacher should discuss what the teacher learned, and how the teacher will apply the learning to lesson planning, instruction and assessment practices. </span></p>
								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resource Education Support Teachers may direct a maximum of 25% of time on direct instruction or intervention with small groups of children, and occasionally, with individual students, but in all cases with specific entry and exit criteria, and documentation of outcomes achieved. (Policy 322) Essential</span><strong> to this student support, is EST and teacher collaborative planning and monitoring of student skill development.</strong></p>

								<p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p>
								<p>In high performing schools, leaders, staff members and teams seek the guidance and support of available subject-area coordinators, leads, and specialists on a routine basis in order to foster expertise in instructional practices and pedagogy. </p>
								<p>Teams collaboratively identify EST/subject-area coordinator support as a resource to support the identified achievement goals. Action items in meeting minutes reflect EST/subject-area coordinator involvement, follow-up, PL or support. </p>
								<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
								<p>Support for targeted, job-embedded professional learning includes: </p>
								<ul>
								<li>In-class instructional coaching (e.g., modeling of specific, pre-identified pedagogy) </li>
								<li>Common planning time (CPT), PLC, grade-level team meetings (e.g., data analysis) </li>
								<li>ESS Team meetings </li>
								<li>Staff-wide professional learning opportunities (e.g., portion of each monthly staff meeting, school-based PL day session) </li>
								<li>Teacher/EST/subject-area coordinator emails, phone calls, and hallway conversations</li>
								<li>ESTs and subject area coordinators are aware of school achievement trends, existing instructional practices, and next professional learning steps</li>
								</ul>
